## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of Invention

This invention relates to clinical trial management systems, specifically to systems and methods for managing clinical research data with complete audit trails, regulatory compliance capabilities, and support for protocol versioning and amendments.

### Description of Related Art

Clinical trials are highly regulated processes that require:
1. **Complete audit trails** for all data changes (FDA 21 CFR Part 11)
2. **Protocol versioning** to track amendments and changes
3. **Data integrity** with immutable historical records
4. **Compliance documentation** for regulatory submissions
5. **Multi-user collaboration** with conflict resolution

#### Problems with Existing Systems

**1. Legacy CTMS Limitations:**
- **Medidata Rave**, **Oracle Clinical**, **Veeva Vault**: Use traditional relational databases with update-in-place models
- **Audit trails are afterthoughts**: Added as separate audit tables, not architecturally integrated
- **Version management is manual**: Protocol amendments require complex data migration
- **Data loss risk**: Updates overwrite previous states
- **Limited time-travel**: Cannot reconstruct exact study state at arbitrary points in time
- **Compliance burden**: Requires manual documentation and validation

**2. Technical Deficiencies:**
- **No immutable event history**: Traditional databases use UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Weak audit trails**: Separate audit tables can be incomplete or inconsistent
- **Poor versioning support**: Protocol changes require database migrations
- **Scalability issues**: Single database becomes bottleneck
- **Integration challenges**: Difficult to connect with external systems

**3. Regulatory Challenges:**
- **Manual compliance verification**: Expensive and error-prone
- **Limited traceability**: Hard to prove data integrity
- **Amendment complexity**: Protocol changes disrupt ongoing trials
- **Inspection readiness**: Takes weeks to prepare for FDA audits

### Need for Invention

There is a critical need for a clinical trial management system that:
1. Provides **architectural-level compliance** (not add-on features)
2. Enables **automatic audit trail generation** from system design
3. Supports **seamless protocol versioning** without data migration
4. Allows **time-travel capabilities** to reconstruct any historical state
5. Ensures **data immutability** for regulatory confidence
6. Scales efficiently for large multi-site trials

**No existing CTMS platform addresses these needs through architectural design.**

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

### Overview

The present invention provides a clinical trial management system based on **event sourcing architecture**, where all state changes are captured as immutable events in an append-only event store. This architectural approach fundamentally solves compliance, audit trail, and versioning challenges that plague traditional CTMS platforms.

### Key Components

1. **Event Store**: Append-only database storing all clinical trial events
2. **Event-Sourced Aggregates**: Domain objects (Study, Patient, Visit, Form) reconstructed from events
3. **Command Handlers**: Process user actions and generate events
4. **Event Handlers**: React to events and update read models
5. **Projectors**: Build queryable views from event streams
6. **Snapshot System**: Optimize performance for long event streams

### Novel Features

#### 1. **Immutable Event History**
- All changes captured as events (never updated or deleted)
- Complete audit trail by architectural design
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance built-in

#### 2. **Protocol Version Management**
- Each protocol amendment creates new version
- Patients enrolled under specific version
- Data tagged with protocol version (build_id)
- No data migration required for amendments

#### 3. **Time-Travel Capabilities**
- Reconstruct study state at any point in time
- Query historical data without separate archives
- Replay events to debug or verify outcomes

#### 4. **Automated Audit Trail Generation**
- Every event contains: who, what, when, why
- Audit reports generated from event stream
- No separate audit tables to maintain

#### 5. **Scalability Through CQRS**
- Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Separate read/write models for performance
- Event bus enables microservices architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Event Store (Claim 1)

**Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_store (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Study, Patient, Visit, Form
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,     -- StudyCreated, PatientEnrolled
    event_version INT NOT NULL,
    event_data JSON NOT NULL,             -- Event payload
    metadata JSON,                         -- User, timestamp, reason
    occurred_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    sequence_number BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    INDEX idx_aggregate (aggregate_type, aggregate_id),
    INDEX idx_occurred_at (occurred_at)
);
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Append-only**: No UPDATE or DELETE operations
- **Immutable**: Events never modified after creation
- **Complete history**: All state changes preserved
- **Ordered**: Sequence number ensures correct replay

#### 2. Event-Sourced Aggregates (Claim 2)

**Study Aggregate Example:**
```java
@Aggregate
public class StudyAggregate {
    @AggregateIdentifier
    private UUID studyId;
    
    private String protocolNumber;
    private StudyStatus status;
    private UUID currentBuildId;
    
    // Command Handler - Creates events
    @CommandHandler
    public StudyAggregate(CreateStudyCommand command) {
        // Validate business rules
        if (command.getProtocolNumber() == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Protocol number required");
        }
        
        // Apply event (not direct state change)
        AggregateLifecycle.apply(new StudyCreatedEvent(
            command.getStudyId(),
            command.getProtocolNumber(),
            command.getOrganizationId(),
            command.getCreatedBy(),
            Instant.now()
        ));
    }
    
    // Event Handler - Updates state
    @EventSourcingHandler
    public void on(StudyCreatedEvent event) {
        this.studyId = event.getStudyId();
        this.protocolNumber = event.getProtocolNumber();
        this.status = StudyStatus.PLANNING;
    }
    
    // State reconstructed by replaying all events
    // No direct database queries for aggregate state
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**
- Aggregates have no persistence logic
- State derived from events only
- Commands validated before events created
- Event handlers update in-memory state

#### 3. Protocol Versioning System (Claim 3)

**Build Version Management:**
```java
// Phase 1: Create protocol version (amendment)
public void createProtocolBuild(UUID studyId, String reason) {
    UUID buildId = UUID.randomUUID();
    
    // Emit event for new build
    apply(new ProtocolBuildCreatedEvent(
        buildId,
        studyId,
        versionNumber,      // e.g., "2.0"
        amendmentType,      // MAJOR, MINOR, SAFETY
        reason,
        previousBuildId,
        createdBy,
        Instant.now()
    ));
}

// Phase 2: Tag mappings with build version
public void tagVisitFormsWithBuild(UUID buildId) {
    jdbcTemplate.update(
        "UPDATE visit_forms SET build_id = ? WHERE study_id = ? AND build_id IS NULL",
        buildId, studyId
    );
    
    apply(new VisitFormsMappedToBuildEvent(buildId, mappingCount));
}

// Phase 3: Patient enrollment uses active build
public void enrollPatient(Long patientId, UUID studyId) {
    // Get most recent COMPLETED build
    UUID activeBuildId = getActiveStudyBuild(studyId).getId();
    
    // Create visit instances tagged with build version
    createVisitInstance(patientId, visitDef, activeBuildId);
    
    // All patient data now tied to specific protocol version
}
```

**Key Innovation:**
- Protocol amendments don't require data migration
- Patients remain on their enrolled protocol version
- New patients get latest approved version
- Historical data integrity preserved

#### 4. Audit Trail Generation (Claim 4)

**Automatic Audit Reports:**
```java
// Generate audit trail for any aggregate
public List<AuditEntry> getAuditTrail(UUID aggregateId) {
    // Query event store (no separate audit tables)
    List<Event> events = eventStore.findByAggregateId(aggregateId);
    
    return events.stream().map(event -> AuditEntry.builder()
        .timestamp(event.getOccurredAt())
        .user(event.getMetadata().getUser())
        .action(event.getEventType())
        .changes(event.getEventData())
        .reason(event.getMetadata().getReason())
        .ipAddress(event.getMetadata().getIpAddress())
        .build()
    ).collect(Collectors.toList());
}

// FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance Report
public ComplianceReport generateComplianceReport(UUID studyId) {
    List<Event> events = eventStore.findByAggregateTypeAndId("Study", studyId);
    
    return ComplianceReport.builder()
        .totalEvents(events.size())
        .userActions(groupByUser(events))
        .criticalChanges(filterCriticalEvents(events))
        .dataIntegrityHash(calculateHash(events))
        .generatedAt(Instant.now())
        .build();
}
```

**Compliance Features:**
- Every event contains audit metadata
- No separate audit log to maintain
- Tamper-proof (append-only store)
- Complete traceability by design

#### 5. Time-Travel Capabilities (Claim 5)

**State Reconstruction:**
```java
// Reconstruct study state at specific date
public StudyAggregate getStudyStateAt(UUID studyId, Instant pointInTime) {
    // Get all events up to specified time
    List<Event> events = eventStore
        .findByAggregateId(studyId)
        .filter(e -> e.getOccurredAt().isBefore(pointInTime))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    // Replay events to rebuild state
    StudyAggregate study = new StudyAggregate();
    events.forEach(event -> study.applyEvent(event));
    
    return study;
}

// Answer regulatory questions
// "What was the patient enrollment count on June 1, 2024?"
public int getEnrollmentCountAt(UUID studyId, LocalDate date) {
    StudyAggregate study = getStudyStateAt(studyId, date.atStartOfDay());
    return study.getEnrolledPatientCount();
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Regulatory inspections: Show exact state during audit period
- Debugging: Reproduce issues by replaying events
- Compliance verification: Prove no data tampering
- Historical reporting: Generate reports for any time period

#### 6. CQRS Pattern for Scalability (Claim 6)

**Separate Read/Write Models:**
```java
// WRITE SIDE: Commands create events
@CommandHandler
public void handle(EnrollPatientCommand command) {
    // Validate business rules
    validateEligibility(command.getPatientId());
    
    // Emit event
    apply(new PatientEnrolledEvent(
        command.getPatientId(),
        command.getStudyId(),
        command.getSiteId(),
        Instant.now()
    ));
}

// READ SIDE: Projectors build query models
@EventHandler
public void on(PatientEnrolledEvent event) {
    // Update denormalized read model
    jdbcTemplate.update(
        "INSERT INTO patient_enrollment_view " +
        "(patient_id, study_id, site_id, enrollment_date, status) " +
        "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 'ACTIVE')",
        event.getPatientId(),
        event.getStudyId(),
        event.getSiteId(),
        event.getOccurredAt()
    );
}
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- Write model: Simple append operations
- Read model: Optimized for queries
- Independent scaling of reads/writes
- Multiple projections for different views

#### 7. Snapshot Optimization (Claim 7)

**Performance for Long Event Streams:**
```java
// Create snapshot every N events
@Aggregate(snapshotTriggerDefinition = "snapshotTrigger")
public class StudyAggregate {
    
    @SnapshotTrigger
    public void onEvent(@SequenceNumber long sequenceNumber) {
        // Snapshot every 100 events
        return sequenceNumber % 100 == 0;
    }
}

// Load from snapshot + subsequent events
public StudyAggregate loadAggregate(UUID studyId) {
    // 1. Load latest snapshot (if exists)
    Optional<Snapshot> snapshot = snapshotStore.findLatest(studyId);
    
    // 2. Load events after snapshot
    List<Event> events = eventStore
        .findByAggregateId(studyId)
        .filter(e -> e.getSequenceNumber() > snapshot.getSequenceNumber())
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    // 3. Restore from snapshot + replay remaining events
    StudyAggregate study = snapshot.isPresent() 
        ? deserialize(snapshot.get())
        : new StudyAggregate();
    
    events.forEach(event -> study.applyEvent(event));
    
    return study;
}
```

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Snapshots reduce event replay overhead
- Configurable snapshot frequency
- Transparent to application logic
- Old snapshots can be deleted (events remain)

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Study Creation with Audit Trail

```java
// User creates study
CreateStudyCommand command = CreateStudyCommand.builder()
    .studyId(UUID.randomUUID())
    .protocolNumber("PROTO-2025-001")
    .organizationId(123L)
    .createdBy(userId)
    .reason("New Phase III hypertension trial")
    .build();

commandGateway.send(command);

// Event generated automatically
StudyCreatedEvent event = StudyCreatedEvent.builder()
    .studyId(command.getStudyId())
    .protocolNumber("PROTO-2025-001")
    .organizationId(123L)
    .createdBy(userId)
    .occurredAt(Instant.now())
    .build();

// Event saved to event store (append-only)
eventStore.save(event);

// Audit trail entry automatically available
AuditEntry entry = AuditEntry.builder()
    .timestamp(event.getOccurredAt())
    .user("Dr. Jane Smith")
    .action("STUDY_CREATED")
    .details("Created protocol PROTO-2025-001")
    .reason("New Phase III hypertension trial")
    .build();
```

### Example 2: Protocol Amendment Without Data Migration

```java
// Create protocol amendment (version 2.0)
CreateProtocolVersionCommand command = CreateProtocolVersionCommand.builder()
    .versionId(UUID.randomUUID())
    .studyAggregateUuid(studyId)
    .versionNumber("2.0")
    .amendmentType(AmendmentType.MAJOR)
    .changesSummary("Added 2 new study visits")
    .requiresRegulatoryApproval(true)
    .build();

// Create build and tag visit forms
UUID buildId = protocolVersionService.createVersion(command);
studyBuildService.executeBuild(studyId, buildId);

// Existing patients remain on version 1.0
Patient existingPatient = getPatient(existingPatientId);
assert existingPatient.getBuildId().equals(oldBuildId); // Still version 1.0

// New patients get version 2.0
enrollPatient(newPatientId, studyId);
Patient newPatient = getPatient(newPatientId);
assert newPatient.getBuildId().equals(buildId); // New version 2.0

// No data migration required!
```

### Example 3: FDA Inspection - Time Travel Query

```java
// FDA asks: "How many patients were enrolled on June 1, 2024?"
LocalDate inspectionDate = LocalDate.of(2024, 6, 1);

// Reconstruct study state at that date
StudyAggregate study = eventSourcingService.getAggregateAt(
    studyId, 
    inspectionDate.atStartOfDay()
);

int enrollmentCount = study.getEnrolledPatientCount();

// Generate compliance report for that period
ComplianceReport report = complianceService.generateReport(
    studyId,
    LocalDate.of(2024, 1, 1),  // Start of year
    inspectionDate              // Inspection date
);

// Report shows:
// - All patient enrollments with dates
// - All protocol amendments
// - All data changes with audit trail
// - Data integrity hash for verification
```

### Publications
- Event Sourcing Pattern (Martin Fowler, 2005)
- CQRS Pattern (Greg Young, 2010)
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Guidance (FDA, 1997)
- ICH-GCP Guidelines (ICH, 1996)

### Existing Systems
- Medidata Rave (traditional database, separate audit tables)
- Oracle Clinical (relational database, manual versioning)
- Veeva Vault (document-centric, not event-sourced)

**Key Differentiation**: No existing CTMS uses event sourcing architecture for clinical trials. This is a novel application of the event sourcing pattern to a domain with unique regulatory and compliance requirements.
