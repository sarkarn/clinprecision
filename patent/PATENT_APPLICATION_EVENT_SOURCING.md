## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of Invention

This invention relates to Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems with integrated clinical trial management capabilities, specifically to systems and methods for capturing, managing, and validating clinical research data with complete audit trails, regulatory compliance capabilities, and support for protocol versioning and amendments.

### Description of Related Art

Clinical trials require robust electronic data capture combined with essential trial management functions:
1. **Complete audit trails** for all data changes (FDA 21 CFR Part 11)
2. **Electronic case report forms (eCRFs)** for patient data collection
3. **Protocol versioning** to track amendments and changes
4. **Data integrity** with immutable historical records
5. **Patient enrollment and visit management** to coordinate data collection
6. **Compliance documentation** for regulatory submissions
7. **Multi-user collaboration** with conflict resolution

#### Problems with Existing Systems

**1. Legacy EDC System Limitations:**
- **Medidata Rave**, **Oracle Clinical**, **OpenClinica**: Use traditional relational databases with update-in-place models
- **Audit trails are afterthoughts**: Added as separate audit tables, not architecturally integrated
- **Version management is manual**: Protocol amendments require complex data migration
- **Data loss risk**: Updates overwrite previous states
- **Limited time-travel**: Cannot reconstruct exact study state at arbitrary points in time
- **Compliance burden**: Requires manual documentation and validation
- **Siloed functionality**: EDC data capture separated from trial management, leading to integration issues

**2. Technical Deficiencies:**
- **No immutable event history**: Traditional databases use UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Weak audit trails**: Separate audit tables can be incomplete or inconsistent
- **Poor versioning support**: Protocol changes require database migrations
- **Scalability issues**: Single database becomes bottleneck
- **Integration challenges**: Difficult to connect EDC data with trial management workflows
- **Form-centric instead of event-centric**: Focus on current state rather than complete history

**3. Regulatory Challenges:**
- **Manual compliance verification**: Expensive and error-prone
- **Limited traceability**: Hard to prove data integrity across EDC and trial management
- **Amendment complexity**: Protocol changes disrupt ongoing trials and data collection
- **Inspection readiness**: Takes weeks to prepare for FDA audits
- **Disconnected systems**: EDC and CTMS often separate, causing data reconciliation issues

### Need for Invention

There is a critical need for an electronic data capture system with integrated clinical trial management that:
1. Provides **architectural-level compliance** (not add-on features)
2. Enables **automatic audit trail generation** from system design
3. **Unifies data capture with trial management** (patient enrollment, visits, protocol deviations)
4. Supports **seamless protocol versioning** without data migration
5. Allows **time-travel capabilities** to reconstruct any historical state
6. Ensures **data immutability** for regulatory confidence
7. Scales efficiently for large multi-site trials
8. **Connects eCRF data to clinical workflows** within a single architectural framework

**No existing EDC platform addresses these needs through architectural design while seamlessly integrating data capture with essential trial management capabilities.**

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

### Overview

The present invention provides an **Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system with integrated clinical trial management capabilities** based on **event sourcing architecture**, where all state changes are captured as immutable events in an append-only event store. This architectural approach fundamentally solves compliance, audit trail, and versioning challenges that plague traditional EDC platforms while seamlessly unifying data capture workflows with essential trial management functions such as patient enrollment, visit scheduling, and protocol deviation tracking.

### Key Components

1. **Event Store**: Append-only database storing all clinical data capture and trial management events
2. **Event-Sourced Aggregates**: Domain objects (Study, Form Data, Patient, Visit, Protocol Deviation) reconstructed from events
3. **Command Handlers**: Process user actions (form submissions, patient enrollment, visit scheduling) and generate events
4. **Event Handlers**: React to events and update read models
5. **Projectors**: Build queryable views from event streams for eCRF data and trial management
6. **Snapshot System**: Optimize performance for long event streams
7. **Unified Data Model**: Links eCRF form submissions to patients, visits, and protocol versions through event relationships

### Novel Features

#### 1. **Immutable Event History for Data Capture**
- All form submissions and data changes captured as events (never updated or deleted)
- Complete audit trail by architectural design
- FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance built-in for eCRF data

#### 2. **Protocol Version Management**
- Each protocol amendment creates new version
- Patients enrolled under specific version
- All data tagged with protocol version (build_id)
- No data migration required for amendments

#### 3. **Unified EDC and Trial Management**
- Form data submissions linked to visit instances via events
- Patient enrollment events coordinate with visit scheduling
- Protocol deviation tracking integrated with data capture workflow
- Single event stream connects all clinical trial activities

#### 4. **Time-Travel Capabilities**
- Reconstruct study state at any point in time
- Query historical eCRF data without separate archives
- Replay events to debug or verify outcomes
- Answer regulatory questions about data states at specific dates

#### 5. **Automated Audit Trail Generation**
- Every event contains: who, what, when, why
- Audit reports generated from event stream
- No separate audit tables to maintain
- Complete traceability from patient enrollment through data collection to study completion

#### 6. **Scalability Through CQRS**
- Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Separate read/write models for performance
- Event bus enables microservices architecture
- Independent scaling of data capture and trial management services

### Core Components

#### 1. Event Store (Claim 1)

**Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_store (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Study, Patient, Visit, Form
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,     -- StudyCreated, PatientEnrolled
    event_version INT NOT NULL,
    event_data JSON NOT NULL,             -- Event payload
    metadata JSON,                         -- User, timestamp, reason
    occurred_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    sequence_number BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    INDEX idx_aggregate (aggregate_type, aggregate_id),
    INDEX idx_occurred_at (occurred_at)
);
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Append-only**: No UPDATE or DELETE operations
- **Immutable**: Events never modified after creation
- **Complete history**: All state changes preserved
- **Ordered**: Sequence number ensures correct replay

#### 2. Event-Sourced Aggregates (Claim 2)

**Study Aggregate Example:**
```java
@Aggregate
public class StudyAggregate {
    @AggregateIdentifier
    private UUID studyId;
    
    private String protocolNumber;
    private StudyStatus status;
    private UUID currentBuildId;
    
    // Command Handler - Creates events
    @CommandHandler
    public StudyAggregate(CreateStudyCommand command) {
        // Validate business rules
        if (command.getProtocolNumber() == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Protocol number required");
        }
        
        // Apply event (not direct state change)
        AggregateLifecycle.apply(new StudyCreatedEvent(
            command.getStudyId(),
            command.getProtocolNumber(),
            command.getOrganizationId(),
            command.getCreatedBy(),
            Instant.now()
        ));
    }
    
    // Event Handler - Updates state
    @EventSourcingHandler
    public void on(StudyCreatedEvent event) {
        this.studyId = event.getStudyId();
        this.protocolNumber = event.getProtocolNumber();
        this.status = StudyStatus.PLANNING;
    }
    
    // State reconstructed by replaying all events
    // No direct database queries for aggregate state
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**
- Aggregates have no persistence logic
- State derived from events only
- Commands validated before events created
- Event handlers update in-memory state

#### 3. Protocol Versioning System (Claim 3)

**Build Version Management:**
```java
// Phase 1: Create protocol version (amendment)
public void createProtocolBuild(UUID studyId, String reason) {
    UUID buildId = UUID.randomUUID();
    
    // Emit event for new build
    apply(new ProtocolBuildCreatedEvent(
        buildId,
        studyId,
        versionNumber,      // e.g., "2.0"
        amendmentType,      // MAJOR, MINOR, SAFETY
        reason,
        previousBuildId,
        createdBy,
        Instant.now()
    ));
}

// Phase 2: Tag mappings with build version
public void tagVisitFormsWithBuild(UUID buildId) {
    jdbcTemplate.update(
        "UPDATE visit_forms SET build_id = ? WHERE study_id = ? AND build_id IS NULL",
        buildId, studyId
    );
    
    apply(new VisitFormsMappedToBuildEvent(buildId, mappingCount));
}

// Phase 3: Patient enrollment uses active build
public void enrollPatient(Long patientId, UUID studyId) {
    // Get most recent COMPLETED build
    UUID activeBuildId = getActiveStudyBuild(studyId).getId();
    
    // Create visit instances tagged with build version
    createVisitInstance(patientId, visitDef, activeBuildId);
    
    // All patient data now tied to specific protocol version
}
```

**Key Innovation:**
- Protocol amendments don't require data migration
- Patients remain on their enrolled protocol version
- New patients get latest approved version
- Historical data integrity preserved

#### 4. Audit Trail Generation (Claim 4)

**Automatic Audit Reports:**
```java
// Generate audit trail for any aggregate
public List<AuditEntry> getAuditTrail(UUID aggregateId) {
    // Query event store (no separate audit tables)
    List<Event> events = eventStore.findByAggregateId(aggregateId);
    
    return events.stream().map(event -> AuditEntry.builder()
        .timestamp(event.getOccurredAt())
        .user(event.getMetadata().getUser())
        .action(event.getEventType())
        .changes(event.getEventData())
        .reason(event.getMetadata().getReason())
        .ipAddress(event.getMetadata().getIpAddress())
        .build()
    ).collect(Collectors.toList());
}

// FDA 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance Report
public ComplianceReport generateComplianceReport(UUID studyId) {
    List<Event> events = eventStore.findByAggregateTypeAndId("Study", studyId);
    
    return ComplianceReport.builder()
        .totalEvents(events.size())
        .userActions(groupByUser(events))
        .criticalChanges(filterCriticalEvents(events))
        .dataIntegrityHash(calculateHash(events))
        .generatedAt(Instant.now())
        .build();
}
```

**Compliance Features:**
- Every event contains audit metadata
- No separate audit log to maintain
- Tamper-proof (append-only store)
- Complete traceability by design

#### 5. Time-Travel Capabilities (Claim 5)

**State Reconstruction:**
```java
// Reconstruct study state at specific date
public StudyAggregate getStudyStateAt(UUID studyId, Instant pointInTime) {
    // Get all events up to specified time
    List<Event> events = eventStore
        .findByAggregateId(studyId)
        .filter(e -> e.getOccurredAt().isBefore(pointInTime))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    // Replay events to rebuild state
    StudyAggregate study = new StudyAggregate();
    events.forEach(event -> study.applyEvent(event));
    
    return study;
}

// Answer regulatory questions
// "What was the patient enrollment count on June 1, 2024?"
public int getEnrollmentCountAt(UUID studyId, LocalDate date) {
    StudyAggregate study = getStudyStateAt(studyId, date.atStartOfDay());
    return study.getEnrolledPatientCount();
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Regulatory inspections: Show exact state during audit period
- Debugging: Reproduce issues by replaying events
- Compliance verification: Prove no data tampering
- Historical reporting: Generate reports for any time period

#### 6. CQRS Pattern for Scalability (Claim 6)

**Separate Read/Write Models:**
```java
// WRITE SIDE: Commands create events
@CommandHandler
public void handle(EnrollPatientCommand command) {
    // Validate business rules
    validateEligibility(command.getPatientId());
    
    // Emit event
    apply(new PatientEnrolledEvent(
        command.getPatientId(),
        command.getStudyId(),
        command.getSiteId(),
        Instant.now()
    ));
}

// READ SIDE: Projectors build query models
@EventHandler
public void on(PatientEnrolledEvent event) {
    // Update denormalized read model
    jdbcTemplate.update(
        "INSERT INTO patient_enrollment_view " +
        "(patient_id, study_id, site_id, enrollment_date, status) " +
        "VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, 'ACTIVE')",
        event.getPatientId(),
        event.getStudyId(),
        event.getSiteId(),
        event.getOccurredAt()
    );
}
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- Write model: Simple append operations
- Read model: Optimized for queries
- Independent scaling of reads/writes
- Multiple projections for different views

#### 7. Snapshot Optimization (Claim 7)

**Performance for Long Event Streams:**
```java
// Create snapshot every N events
@Aggregate(snapshotTriggerDefinition = "snapshotTrigger")
public class StudyAggregate {
    
    @SnapshotTrigger
    public void onEvent(@SequenceNumber long sequenceNumber) {
        // Snapshot every 100 events
        return sequenceNumber % 100 == 0;
    }
}

// Load from snapshot + subsequent events
public StudyAggregate loadAggregate(UUID studyId) {
    // 1. Load latest snapshot (if exists)
    Optional<Snapshot> snapshot = snapshotStore.findLatest(studyId);
    
    // 2. Load events after snapshot
    List<Event> events = eventStore
        .findByAggregateId(studyId)
        .filter(e -> e.getSequenceNumber() > snapshot.getSequenceNumber())
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    
    // 3. Restore from snapshot + replay remaining events
    StudyAggregate study = snapshot.isPresent() 
        ? deserialize(snapshot.get())
        : new StudyAggregate();
    
    events.forEach(event -> study.applyEvent(event));
    
    return study;
}
```

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Snapshots reduce event replay overhead
- Configurable snapshot frequency
- Transparent to application logic
- Old snapshots can be deleted (events remain)

StudyCreatedEvent event = StudyCreatedEvent.builder()
    .studyId(command.getStudyId())
    .protocolNumber("PROTO-2025-001")
    .organizationId(123L)
    .createdBy(userId)
    .occurredAt(Instant.now())
    .build();

// Event saved to event store (append-only)
eventStore.save(event);

// Audit trail entry automatically available
AuditEntry entry = AuditEntry.builder()
    .timestamp(event.getOccurredAt())
    .user("Dr. Jane Smith")
    .action("STUDY_CREATED")

```

### Example 2: Protocol Amendment Without Data Migration

```java
// Create protocol amendment (version 2.0)
CreateProtocolVersionCommand command = CreateProtocolVersionCommand.builder()
    .versionId(UUID.randomUUID())
    .studyAggregateUuid(studyId)
    .versionNumber("2.0")
    .amendmentType(AmendmentType.MAJOR)
    .changesSummary("Added 2 new study visits")
    .requiresRegulatoryApproval(true)
    .build();

// Create build and tag visit forms
UUID buildId = protocolVersionService.createVersion(command);
studyBuildService.executeBuild(studyId, buildId);

// Existing patients remain on version 1.0
Patient existingPatient = getPatient(existingPatientId);
assert existingPatient.getBuildId().equals(oldBuildId); // Still version 1.0

// New patients get version 2.0
enrollPatient(newPatientId, studyId);
Patient newPatient = getPatient(newPatientId);
assert newPatient.getBuildId().equals(buildId); // New version 2.0

// No data migration required!
```

### Example 3: FDA Inspection - Time Travel Query

```java
// FDA asks: "How many patients were enrolled on June 1, 2024?"
LocalDate inspectionDate = LocalDate.of(2024, 6, 1);

// Reconstruct study state at that date
StudyAggregate study = eventSourcingService.getAggregateAt(
    studyId, 
    inspectionDate.atStartOfDay()
);

int enrollmentCount = study.getEnrolledPatientCount();

// Generate compliance report for that period
ComplianceReport report = complianceService.generateReport(
    studyId,
    LocalDate.of(2024, 1, 1),  // Start of year
    inspectionDate              // Inspection date
);

// Report shows:
// - All patient enrollments with dates
// - All protocol amendments
// - All data changes with audit trail
// - Data integrity hash for verification
```
