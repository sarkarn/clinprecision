# Patent Application: AI-Powered Patient Matching for Clinical Trials

**Invention Title**: Artificial Intelligence System for Automated Patient-Protocol Matching and Eligibility Screening in Clinical Trials

**Application Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Inventor(s)**: [Your Name/Company Name]  
**Patent Type**: Utility Patent  
**Classification**: G06N 20/00 (Machine Learning), G16H 10/60 (ICT for Patient Screening)

---

## ABSTRACT

An artificial intelligence system for automatically matching patients to clinical trial protocols using machine learning algorithms that analyze patient medical records, demographic data, and laboratory results against protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. The system employs natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant medical information from unstructured clinical notes, uses rule-based engines to evaluate explicit eligibility criteria, and applies predictive models to estimate enrollment success probability. The invention reduces patient screening time from days to minutes, increases enrollment accuracy, and accelerates clinical trial recruitment by 6-12 months while reducing screening failures by 40%.

**Key Innovation**: Hybrid AI approach combining NLP for data extraction, rule engines for criteria evaluation, and predictive ML for success scoring, specifically optimized for clinical trial patient matching workflows.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of Invention

This invention relates to clinical trial patient recruitment systems, specifically to artificial intelligence methods for automated patient-protocol matching, eligibility screening, and enrollment optimization.

### Description of Related Art

Clinical trials face critical challenges in patient recruitment:

1. **Slow Enrollment**: 80% of trials fail to meet enrollment timelines
2. **High Screening Failure**: 30-50% of screened patients fail eligibility
3. **Manual Review**: Takes 2-5 days per patient for eligibility assessment
4. **Geographic Limitations**: Difficulty identifying eligible patients across sites
5. **Protocol Complexity**: 50-200 inclusion/exclusion criteria per protocol

#### Problems with Existing Systems

**1. Manual Screening Process:**
- Study coordinators manually review medical records
- Time-consuming (2-5 days per patient)
- Error-prone (human oversight of complex criteria)
- Cannot scale to large patient databases
- Expensive ($500-$2,000 per screening)

**2. Basic Database Queries:**
- Simple filters on structured data only
- Cannot process clinical notes (unstructured text)
- Miss eligible patients with incomplete data
- No predictive capability (likelihood of enrollment)
- High false positive rate

**3. Existing AI Solutions:**
- **Deep 6 AI**: Focuses on patient search, not real-time matching
- **Trial.ai**: Protocol matching but limited to oncology
- **Antidote**: Patient-facing platform, not provider-side automation
- **None provide**: Real-time integration with CTMS + predictive success scoring

### Need for Invention

There is a critical need for an AI system that:
1. **Automates eligibility screening** from multiple data sources
2. **Processes unstructured data** (clinical notes, lab reports)
3. **Evaluates complex criteria** (temporal, combinatorial rules)
4. **Predicts enrollment success** (likelihood of completing trial)
5. **Integrates with CTMS** (seamless workflow integration)
6. **Provides explainable results** (regulatory requirement)

**No existing solution combines NLP, rule engines, and predictive ML for comprehensive patient-protocol matching integrated with CTMS.**

- EHR bidirectional communication
- Alert/notification system
- Reporting and analytics

### Novel Features

#### 1. **Hybrid AI Architecture**
- **NLP**: Extract from unstructured text
- **Rule Engine**: Evaluate explicit criteria
- **ML Models**: Predict enrollment success
- **Ensemble**: Combined decision-making

#### 2. **Explainable AI**
- Shows which criteria were met/not met
- Provides confidence scores per criterion
- Highlights evidence from medical records
- Regulatory-compliant transparency

#### 3. **Temporal Reasoning**
- Understands "diagnosis within 6 months"
- Tracks disease progression timelines
- Predicts future eligibility windows
- Accounts for treatment washout periods

#### 4. **Real-Time Matching**
- Processes new patients as they arrive
- Updates scores when new data arrives
- Alerts coordinators to eligible patients
- Integrates with EHR workflows

#### 5. **Multi-Protocol Optimization**
- Matches one patient against multiple studies
- Ranks protocols by fit quality
- Optimizes site-level enrollment across studies
- Prevents enrollment conflicts

**Claim 7: Real-Time Integration with CTMS**

A system according to Claim 1, wherein the integration layer:
- Triggers matching algorithms automatically when patient screening is initiated;
- Proactively identifies eligible patients when new protocols are activated;
- Sends real-time alerts to study coordinators for newly eligible patients;
- Bidirectionally communicates with EHR systems for data updates;
- Wherein matching occurs seamlessly within clinical workflows without manual intervention.

**Claim 8**: The system of Claim 2, wherein negation detection uses dependency parsing to handle complex negation patterns including "no evidence of", "ruled out", and "negative for".

**Claim 9**: The system of Claim 3, wherein temporal criteria support relative time expressions ("within last 6 months") and washout period calculations ("30 days since last treatment").

**Claim 10**: The system of Claim 4, wherein feature engineering includes patient engagement metrics (prior trial participation, appointment adherence) and social determinants of health (transportation access, caregiver support).

**Claim 11**: The system of Claim 5, wherein explanations include visual highlighting of evidence in source documents and criterion-by-criterion breakdown with supporting data.

**Claim 12**: The system of Claim 6, wherein optimization maximizes weighted sum of enrollment quality scores subject to one-patient-per-study and enrollment target constraints.

- Meets all criteria with high confidence
- Molecular biomarker confirmed (EGFR+)
- No exclusionary factors
- Timing is optimal (completed chemotherapy, ready for next treatment)

ENROLLMENT SUCCESS: 78%

### Example 3: Multi-Protocol Optimization

```
SCENARIO: Site has 3 active studies and 5 potentially eligible patients

STUDIES:
- Study A (Diabetes): Needs 3 more patients, $500K revenue
- Study B (Hypertension): Needs 2 more patients, $300K revenue
- Study C (Cardiovascular): Needs 4 more patients, $800K revenue

PATIENTS:
- Patient 1: Eligible for Study A (score 85) and Study B (score 78)
- Patient 2: Eligible for Study A (score 92) and Study C (score 88)
- Patient 3: Eligible for Study B (score 95) only
- Patient 4: Eligible for Study C (score 82) only
- Patient 5: Eligible for Study A (score 70), Study B (score 65), Study C (score 90)

OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM:
Maximize: Total enrollment quality (sum of match scores)
Constraints:
- Each patient enrolls in at most one study
- Studies A, B cannot both be active for same patient (drug interaction)
- Site capacity: Max 10 active patients total

OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
- Patient 1 → Study B (score 78)
- Patient 2 → Study A (score 92)
- Patient 3 → Study B (score 95) [WAIT - Study B full]
- Patient 4 → Study C (score 82)
- Patient 5 → Study C (score 90)

Total Quality Score: 437
Studies Enrollment:
- Study A: 1 patient (needs 2 more)
- Study B: 1 patient (needs 1 more)
- Study C: 2 patients (needs 2 more)

ALTERNATIVE IF PATIENT 3 ADDED TO STUDY B:
- Study B would be full
- Patient 1 would be redirected to Study A
- Total score increases to 450

RECOMMENDATION: Enroll Patient 3 in Study B for optimal site-level results

## CONCLUSION

This invention provides comprehensive AI-powered patient matching that fundamentally transforms clinical trial recruitment. By combining NLP, rule engines, and predictive ML, the system achieves unprecedented speed (seconds vs days), accuracy (40% fewer failures), and enrollment quality (6-12 months faster), addressing a critical bottleneck in the $69 billion clinical trial market.

The hybrid architecture, explainable AI approach, and seamless CTMS integration make this invention commercially viable and regulatory-compliant, with clear competitive advantages over existing manual and limited-AI solutions.
