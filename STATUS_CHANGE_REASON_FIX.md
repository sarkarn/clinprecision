# Status Change Reason Requirement - Fix Summary

## Issue
Backend validation error when submitting protocol version for review:
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Status change reason is required
```

**Root Cause:** The `ProtocolVersionAggregate` requires a reason for all status changes (for audit trail purposes), but the frontend was not sending the `reason` field.

## Solution

### ‚úÖ Backend Changes

**File:** `ProtocolVersionBridgeController.java`

Added validation in the bridge controller to ensure reason is provided:

```java
// Step 3: Extract and validate reason
String reason = (String) statusData.get("reason");
if (reason == null || reason.trim().isEmpty()) {
    log.error("BRIDGE: Status change reason is required but not provided");
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest()
        .body(Map.of("error", "Status change reason is required"));
}
log.info("BRIDGE: Status change reason: '{}'", reason);
```

**Benefits:**
- Early validation at API boundary (fail fast)
- Clear error message returned to frontend
- Logging shows what reason was received
- No default reasons (forces explicit audit trail)

### ‚úÖ Frontend Changes

#### 1. **StudyVersioningService.js**

Updated `updateVersionStatus()` to accept optional `reason` parameter:

```javascript
static async updateVersionStatus(versionId, status, reason = null) {
    try {
        const payload = { status };
        if (reason) {
            payload.reason = reason;
        }
        const response = await ApiService.put(
            `/api/study-versions/${versionId}/status`, 
            payload
        );
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating version status:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

#### 2. **useProtocolVersioning.js**

Updated all status change functions to provide meaningful reasons:

```javascript
// Submit for Review
await StudyVersioningService.updateVersionStatus(
    versionId, 
    'UNDER_REVIEW',
    'Submitted for internal review'
);

// Approve Version
await StudyVersioningService.updateVersionStatus(
    versionId, 
    'APPROVED',
    'Protocol version approved'
);

// Activate Version
await StudyVersioningService.updateVersionStatus(
    versionId, 
    'ACTIVE',
    'Protocol version activated for use in trial'
);
```

## Request/Response Flow

### Request (Frontend ‚Üí Backend)
```json
PUT /api/study-versions/1/status
{
    "status": "UNDER_REVIEW",
    "reason": "Submitted for internal review"
}
```

### Validation Path
1. **Bridge Controller** validates reason exists (Step 3)
2. **Command** built with reason
3. **Aggregate** validates reason again (defensive programming)
4. **Event** emitted with reason for audit trail

### Response (Success)
```json
{
    "message": "Status updated successfully",
    "versionId": 1,
    "newStatus": "UNDER_REVIEW"
}
```

### Response (Missing Reason)
```json
{
    "error": "Status change reason is required"
}
```

## Why Reason is Required

### 1. **Audit Trail**
Every status change must have a documented reason for:
- Regulatory compliance (FDA, EMA audits)
- Quality assurance tracking
- Change history documentation
- Root cause analysis

### 2. **Business Logic**
The aggregate emits `VersionStatusChangedEvent` with the reason:
```java
VersionStatusChangedEvent.from(
    command.getVersionId(),
    this.status,           // Old status
    command.getNewStatus(), // New status  
    command.getReason(),    // REQUIRED for audit
    command.getUserId()
)
```

### 3. **Domain Model Integrity**
Status transitions represent important business events that must be:
- Traceable
- Justifiable
- Auditable
- Documented

## Status Change Reasons by Status

| Status | Default Reason |
|--------|---------------|
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | "Submitted for internal review" |
| `SUBMITTED` | "Submitted to regulatory authority" |
| `APPROVED` | "Protocol version approved" |
| `ACTIVE` | "Protocol version activated for use in trial" |
| `SUPERSEDED` | "Replaced by newer version" |
| `WITHDRAWN` | "Withdrawn from use" |
| `AMENDMENT_REVIEW` | "Amendment submitted for review" |

**Note:** In the future, these could be user-provided via UI dialogs for more detailed audit trails.

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Submit for Review with Reason ‚úÖ
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/study-versions/1/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "UNDER_REVIEW",
    "reason": "Submitted for internal review"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Status changed to UNDER_REVIEW
- Event projected to read model
- Reason stored in audit trail

### Test Case 2: Submit for Review without Reason ‚ùå
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/study-versions/1/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "UNDER_REVIEW"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- 400 Bad Request
- Error: "Status change reason is required"

## Logging Example

### Successful Status Change
```
BRIDGE: ====== STATUS UPDATE REQUEST START ======
BRIDGE: Update protocol version status for legacy ID: 1
BRIDGE: Request body: {status=UNDER_REVIEW, reason=Submitted for internal review}
BRIDGE: Querying for protocol version entity by legacy ID...
BRIDGE: ‚úì Resolved legacy ID 1 to aggregate UUID: abc123...
BRIDGE: Current version status: DRAFT
BRIDGE: Attempting to change status from DRAFT to UNDER_REVIEW
BRIDGE: ‚úì Parsed status enum successfully: UNDER_REVIEW
BRIDGE: Status change reason: 'Submitted for internal review'
BRIDGE: Building ChangeVersionStatusCommand...
BRIDGE: ‚úì Command built - versionId: abc123..., newStatus: UNDER_REVIEW, reason: 'Submitted for internal review', userId: 1
BRIDGE: Sending command to ProtocolVersionCommandService...
BRIDGE: ‚úì Command executed successfully!
BRIDGE: ====== STATUS UPDATE REQUEST SUCCESS ======
```

### Missing Reason
```
BRIDGE: ====== STATUS UPDATE REQUEST START ======
BRIDGE: Update protocol version status for legacy ID: 1
BRIDGE: Request body: {status=UNDER_REVIEW}
...
BRIDGE: Status change reason is required but not provided
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **UI Dialogs for Reasons**
Add modal dialogs when clicking status change buttons:
```jsx
<ConfirmDialog
  title="Submit for Review"
  message="Please provide a reason for this status change:"
  inputField={true}
  onConfirm={(reason) => submitForReview(versionId, reason)}
/>
```

### 2. **Reason Templates**
Provide pre-defined reason templates:
- "Initial protocol version submission"
- "Administrative correction"
- "Scientific rationale update"
- "Safety data review"

### 3. **Reason History**
Show reason in version history table:
| Version | Status | Changed By | Date | Reason |
|---------|--------|------------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | UNDER_REVIEW | John Doe | 2025-10-08 | Submitted for internal review |

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Backend:** Validates reason at API boundary  
‚úÖ **Frontend:** Sends appropriate reason for each status change  
‚úÖ **Aggregate:** Enforces reason requirement for audit trail  
‚úÖ **Logging:** Shows reason in detailed execution logs  
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Clear error message when reason missing  

**Result:** Full audit trail compliance with explicit status change justification! üéØ
