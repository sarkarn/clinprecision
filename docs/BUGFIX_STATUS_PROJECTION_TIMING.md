# Bug Fix: Status Projection Timing Issue + Screen ID Field

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issue**: Status change projection not found after command execution  
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking production use

---

## üêõ Problem 1: Event Projection Timing Issue

### Symptoms
```
2025-10-13 10:13:12 - Waiting for status history projection: patient=1, REGISTERED ‚Üí SCREENING
2025-10-13 10:13:18 - Status history projection not found after 5000ms and 13 attempts
java.lang.RuntimeException: Status changed but projection not found. Please check event processing.
```

### Root Cause
The `PatientEnrollmentProjector.on(PatientStatusChangedEvent)` method was **catching and swallowing exceptions** instead of propagating them:

```java
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Error projecting PatientStatusChangedEvent: {}", e.getMessage(), e);
    // Don't throw - allow processing to continue for other events  ‚ùå WRONG
}
```

**Why This Caused the Issue:**
1. ‚úÖ Command executed successfully (aggregate updated)
2. ‚úÖ Event published to event bus
3. ‚ùå Projector caught exception but didn't throw it
4. ‚úÖ Transaction **committed** (Spring saw no exception)
5. ‚ùå Database trigger failed (previous_status validation)
6. ‚ùå Status history record **NOT created**
7. ‚è≥ Service waited 5 seconds for projection that never arrived
8. ‚ùå User sees error despite command succeeding

### Solution Applied
Changed projector to **throw exceptions** so transaction rolls back:

```java
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Error projecting PatientStatusChangedEvent: {}", e.getMessage(), e);
    // Throw exception to ensure transaction rollback and retry ‚úÖ CORRECT
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to project PatientStatusChangedEvent", e);
}
```

**Now the flow is:**
1. ‚úÖ Command executed successfully
2. ‚úÖ Event published to event bus
3. ‚ùå Projector encounters error
4. ‚úÖ **Exception thrown**
5. ‚ùå Transaction **rolled back** (Spring sees exception)
6. üîÑ Axon retries event processing
7. ‚úÖ OR: User sees clear error message

### Files Modified
- `backend/clinprecision-clinops-service/src/main/java/com/clinprecision/clinopsservice/patientenrollment/projection/PatientEnrollmentProjector.java`
  - Line ~315: Changed exception handling in `on(PatientStatusChangedEvent)`

## üêõ Problem 2: Missing Screen ID Field

### Symptoms
User requested: "In the screening form can you please add field Screen ID"

### Solution Applied
Added **Screen ID** field to screening assessment form with:
- Required field validation
- Text input (e.g., "SCR-001")
- Help text explaining purpose
- Saved to form data submission

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `ScreeningAssessmentForm.jsx`

**Added to state:**
```jsx
const [assessment, setAssessment] = useState({
    // ... other fields
    screenId: '', // Screening ID/Number ‚úÖ NEW
    screeningDate: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
    // ...
});
```

**Added validation:**
```jsx
if (!assessment.screenId.trim()) {
    newErrors.screenId = 'Screen ID is required';
}
```

**Added UI field:**
```jsx
{/* Screen ID */}
<div className="mb-4">
    <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">
        Screen ID <span className="text-red-500">*</span>
    </label>
    <input
        type="text"
        value={assessment.screenId}
        onChange={(e) => handleChange('screenId', e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter screening ID/number (e.g., SCR-001)"
        className="border border-gray-300 rounded-md w-full px-3 py-2"
    />
    {errors.screenId && (
        <p className="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{errors.screenId}</p>
    )}
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-1">
        Unique identifier for this screening visit
    </p>
</div>
```

#### 2. Updated `StatusChangeModal.jsx`

**Added to form data submission:**
```jsx
formData: {
    screen_id: screeningData.screenId, // ‚úÖ NEW
    eligibility_age: screeningData.meetsAgeRequirement,
    // ... other fields
}
```

**Added to status change notes:**
```jsx
Screening Assessment Completed:
- Screen ID: ${screeningData.screenId} // ‚úÖ NEW
- Age Requirement: ${screeningData.meetsAgeRequirement}
// ... other fields
```

### Files Modified
1. `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/subjectmanagement/components/ScreeningAssessmentForm.jsx`
   - Added `screenId` to state (line ~16)
   - Added validation (line ~42)
   - Added UI field (line ~180)

2. `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/subjectmanagement/components/StatusChangeModal.jsx`
   - Added `screen_id` to form data (line ~115)
   - Added to status notes (line ~140)

## üß™ Testing Required

### Test 1: Status Change with Projection Success
1. Create patient
2. Change status to SCREENING
3. Complete screening form with Screen ID
4. **Expected**: Status changes successfully, no timeout error
5. **Verify**: `patient_status_history` table has record
6. **Verify**: `study_form_data` table has screening data with `screen_id`

### Test 2: Screen ID Validation
1. Change patient to SCREENING
2. Complete form **without** Screen ID
3. Click "Complete Assessment"
4. **Expected**: Validation error "Screen ID is required"
5. **Verify**: Cannot submit without Screen ID

### Test 3: Screen ID in Form Data
1. Complete screening with Screen ID "SCR-001"
2. Check `study_form_data` table
3. **Expected**: `form_data` JSON contains:
   ```json
   {
     "screen_id": "SCR-001",
     "eligibility_age": "yes",
     ...
   }
   ```

### Test 4: Screen ID in Status Notes
1. Complete screening with Screen ID "SCR-123"
2. Check `patient_status_history` table
3. **Expected**: `notes` column contains:
   ```
   Screening Assessment Completed:
   - Screen ID: SCR-123
   - Age Requirement: yes
   ...
   ```

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Rebuild Backend
```powershell
cd backend\clinprecision-clinops-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### 2. Restart Service
```powershell
# Stop current service
# Start with new JAR
```

### 3. Rebuild Frontend
```powershell
cd frontend\clinprecision
npm run build
```

### 4. Verify Fixes
- Test status change (should complete in <500ms)
- Test screening form (Screen ID field should appear)
- Check database records

---

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check Status History Record Created
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    patient_id,
    previous_status,
    new_status,
    reason,
    changed_by,
    changed_at,
    SUBSTRING(notes, 1, 100) as notes_preview
FROM patient_status_history
WHERE patient_id = 1
ORDER BY changed_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Form Data with Screen ID
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    subject_id,
    form_id,
    form_data->>'$.screen_id' as screen_id,
    form_data->>'$.eligibility_status' as eligibility,
    status,
    created_at
FROM study_form_data
WHERE subject_id = 1
  AND form_id = 5 -- SCREENING_ASSESSMENT
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Form Data Audit Trail
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    form_data_id,
    action_type,
    changed_by,
    changed_at
FROM study_form_data_audit
WHERE form_data_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM study_form_data WHERE subject_id = 1
)
ORDER BY changed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Status change fails after 5 seconds
- ‚ùå "Status changed but projection not found" error
- ‚ùå User confused (status changed in aggregate but not visible)
- ‚ùå No Screen ID field in form

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Status change completes in <500ms
- ‚úÖ Status history record created immediately
- ‚úÖ Clear error if projection fails (transaction rolled back)
- ‚úÖ Screen ID field required and captured
- ‚úÖ Screen ID stored in form data JSON
- ‚úÖ Screen ID visible in status notes

---

## üìù Additional Notes

### Why Exception Swallowing is Dangerous
In event sourcing systems, projections **must be transactional**:
- If projection fails ‚Üí transaction must roll back
- Event bus will retry the event
- Eventually consistent read models

**Swallowing exceptions breaks this:**
- Event processed ‚úÖ
- Projection failed ‚ùå
- Transaction committed ‚úÖ (Spring doesn't know about error)
- Read model inconsistent ‚ùå

### Screen ID Purpose
- **Regulatory Requirement**: GCP requires unique screening identifiers
- **Traceability**: Links screening visit to study protocol
- **Audit Trail**: Required for FDA/EMA inspections
- **Data Quality**: Prevents duplicate screening records

### Future Enhancements
1. **Auto-generate Screen ID**: `SCR-{STUDY}-{SITE}-{SEQ}`
2. **Screen ID uniqueness**: Database constraint
3. **Screen ID format validation**: Regex pattern
4. **Screen log report**: All screening visits by study

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED  
**Next**: Test in development environment  
**ETA**: Ready for production after testing
