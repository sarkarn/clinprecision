# Build Study Database - UX Improvements

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Component:** BuildStudyDatabaseModal.jsx  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## Overview

This document describes the user experience improvements implemented for the "Build Study Database" modal to address two critical usability issues and enhance overall user experience.

---

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Study Dropdown Showing All Studies ❌

**Problem:**
- The study dropdown was showing ALL studies in the system
- No filtering based on study status
- Users could attempt to build databases for studies not ready for build
- Cluttered dropdown with irrelevant studies

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience
- Potential errors when selecting studies in DRAFT or PLANNING status
- Confusion about which studies are ready for database build
- Violation of business rules (only APPROVED/ACTIVE studies should be buildable)

---

### Issue 2: RequestedBy Field Coming as Empty ❌

**Problem:**
- RequestedBy field was showing placeholder text "Current User"
- TODO comment indicated it should come from auth context
- Field appeared empty, requiring manual entry every time
- No integration with authentication system

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience (repetitive data entry)
- Inconsistent user tracking
- Manual errors in typing names
- Lost opportunity for automatic audit trail

---

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Smart Study Filtering ✅

#### Implementation Details

**1. Study Status Filtering**
```javascript
// Filter studies to show only build-ready studies
const buildReadyStudies = (data || []).filter(study => {
    const status = study.studyStatus?.code || study.status;
    return status === 'APPROVED' || status === 'ACTIVE';
});
```

**Business Rules:**
- ✅ Only show studies with status `APPROVED` or `ACTIVE`
- ❌ Hide studies with status `DRAFT`, `PLANNING`, `COMPLETED`, `TERMINATED`, `SUSPENDED`

**Rationale:**
- **APPROVED**: Study has been approved and is ready for database setup
- **ACTIVE**: Study is actively recruiting, database can be rebuilt or expanded
- **DRAFT/PLANNING**: Study design not finalized, premature to build database
- **COMPLETED/TERMINATED**: Study finished, no new database builds needed

**2. Enhanced Dropdown Display**

Shows helpful information for each study:
- Study name
- Protocol number
- Study ID
- **Status badge** (color-coded)
  - Green for ACTIVE
  - Blue for APPROVED

```jsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <div className="font-medium text-gray-900">
        {study.name || study.studyName}
    </div>
    <span className={`text-xs font-medium px-2 py-1 rounded ${statusColor}`}>
        {statusLabel}
    </span>
</div>
```

**3. User Guidance**

Added helpful message above dropdown:
```
"Only studies with status APPROVED or ACTIVE can have databases built"
```

Empty state message when no studies found:
```
"No build-ready studies available. Only APPROVED or ACTIVE studies can have databases built."
```

**4. Context-Aware Pre-selection**

Two scenarios for automatic study selection:

**Scenario A: Accessed from Build Page**
- User clicks "Build Database" button from main build page
- Shows filtered list of all build-ready studies
- User selects study from dropdown

**Scenario B: Accessed from Study Design Dashboard**
- User is viewing a specific study (e.g., `/study-design/study/123`)
- Modal automatically pre-selects the current study
- Study dropdown still accessible to change if needed

```javascript
// Pre-select study from context
const contextStudyId = getCurrentStudyId();
if (contextStudyId && isInStudyContext()) {
    const contextStudy = studies.find(s => 
        s.id === parseInt(contextStudyId) || s.id === contextStudyId
    );
    if (contextStudy) {
        handleStudySelect(contextStudy);
    }
}
```

---

### Solution 2: Auto-filled RequestedBy Field ✅

#### Implementation Details

**1. Auth Context Integration**

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../../../../login/AuthContext';

const { user } = useAuth();
```

**2. Automatic Field Population with Dual Values**

The backend expects `requestedBy` to be a `Long` (user ID), but for better UX, we display the user's email/name:

```javascript
// Backend expects Long userId, but we display email/name for UX
const userId = user?.userId ? parseInt(user.userId) : null;
const displayName = user?.email || user?.name || 'Unknown User';

setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    requestedBy: userId, // Long userId for backend
    requestedByDisplay: displayName, // Display name for UI
}));
```

**Two-Field Approach:**
- `requestedBy` (hidden) - Contains numeric user ID for backend
- `requestedByDisplay` (visible) - Shows user-friendly email/name

**Data Priority:**
1. User ID (userId) - Extracted from auth context, converted to integer
2. Display name - `user.email` → `user.name` → "Unknown User"

**3. Read-Only Display Field**

Field is now read-only since it's automatically populated from auth:

```jsx
<input
    type="text"
    value={formData.requestedByDisplay || ''}
    readOnly
    className="bg-gray-50 text-gray-600 cursor-not-allowed"
    placeholder="User information will be auto-filled"
/>
{formData.requestedBy && (
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
        User ID: {formData.requestedBy}
    </p>
)}
```

Benefits:
- Shows user-friendly name/email in the UI
- Sends correct numeric user ID to backend
- Displays user ID for transparency and debugging
- No manual editing needed (reduces errors)

**4. Enhanced Validation**

```javascript
if (!formData.requestedBy) {
    errors.requestedBy = 'User ID is required. Please ensure you are logged in.';
}

if (formData.requestedBy && (isNaN(formData.requestedBy) || formData.requestedBy <= 0)) {
    errors.requestedBy = 'Invalid user ID. Please re-login.';
}
```

Validation checks:
- User ID exists
- User ID is a valid number
- User ID is positive (> 0)

**5. Backend Contract Compliance**

The backend DTO expects:
```java
@NotNull(message = "Requested by user ID is required")
@Min(value = 1, message = "User ID must be positive")
private Long requestedBy;
```

Our implementation now correctly sends:
```javascript
{
  "studyId": 123,
  "studyName": "Study Name",
  "studyProtocol": "PROTO-001",
  "requestedBy": 456,  // ✅ Long user ID
  "buildConfiguration": {}
}
```

Previously (incorrect):
```javascript
{
  "requestedBy": "nsarkar@clinprecision.com"  // ❌ String, caused 500 error
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added

```javascript
// Auth Context - for user information
import { useAuth } from '../../../../login/AuthContext';

// Study Navigation - for context detection
import { useStudyNavigation } from '../../hooks/useStudyNavigation';
```

### Hooks Used

```javascript
// Get authenticated user
const { user } = useAuth();

// Get study context
const { getCurrentStudyId, isInStudyContext } = useStudyNavigation();
```

### Effects Added

**Effect 1: Load and Filter Studies**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const buildReadyStudies = (data || []).filter(study => {
        const status = study.studyStatus?.code || study.status;
        return status === 'APPROVED' || status === 'ACTIVE';
    });
    setStudies(buildReadyStudies);
}, [isOpen, user]);
```

**Effect 2: Pre-select Study from Context**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (isOpen && studies.length > 0) {
        // Priority 1: Use prop
        if (selectedStudy) {
            handleStudySelect(selectedStudy);
            return;
        }
        
        // Priority 2: Use URL context
        const contextStudyId = getCurrentStudyId();
        if (contextStudyId && isInStudyContext()) {
            const contextStudy = studies.find(s => s.id === parseInt(contextStudyId));
            if (contextStudy) {
                handleStudySelect(contextStudy);
            }
        }
    }
}, [isOpen, studies, selectedStudy, getCurrentStudyId, isInStudyContext]);
```
