## Introduction

### What is Protocol Version Management?

Protocol Version Management in ClinPrecision provides comprehensive tools for managing protocol documents throughout the clinical trial lifecycle. It supports:

- **Initial Protocol Creation** - Document and track your first protocol version
- **Amendment Management** - Handle protocol changes systematically
- **Version Control** - Maintain complete history of protocol revisions
- **Approval Workflows** - Structured approval processes for regulatory compliance
- **Status Tracking** - Real-time visibility into protocol lifecycle stages
- **Regulatory Compliance** - FDA/ICH-GCP compliant workflows

### Key Concepts

#### Protocol Version
A protocol version represents a specific iteration of your study protocol document. Each version has:
- **Version Number** (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- **Status** (Draft ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Superseded)
- **Amendment Type** (Initial, Minor, Major, Substantial)
- **Effective Date** - When the version becomes active
- **Change Description** - What changed and why

#### Study vs. Protocol Status
It's important to understand the distinction:

| Aspect | Study Status | Protocol Version Status |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Scope** | Overall study design and execution | Specific protocol document |
| **Changes When** | Study phases change (Planning ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Completed) | Protocol document changes (Draft ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Active) |
| **Examples** | PLANNING, ACTIVE, COMPLETED | DRAFT, APPROVED, ACTIVE, SUPERSEDED |

### Target Users

- **Protocol Developers** - Create and edit protocol versions
- **Study Managers** - Oversee protocol approval and implementation
- **Regulatory Affairs** - Review and approve protocol changes
- **Principal Investigators** - Final approval authority
- **CRAs/Monitors** - View and track protocol versions at sites

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a Study Version and a Protocol Version?**

A: Study Versions track structural changes to study design (arms, visits, forms), while Protocol Versions track the protocol document itself. They work together but serve different purposes:
- **Study Version:** Configuration changes in the EDC
- **Protocol Version:** Document version and amendment tracking

---

**Q: How many protocol versions can I have?**

A: Unlimited versions. However, only ONE version can be ACTIVE at any time. All previous active versions automatically become SUPERSEDED when a new version is activated.

---

**Q: Can I delete a protocol version?**

A: 
- **DRAFT versions:** Yes, can be deleted if not needed
- **PROTOCOL_REVIEW:** No, must be withdrawn instead
- **APPROVED/ACTIVE/SUPERSEDED:** No, these are permanent records for regulatory compliance

---

**Q: What happens to data when I activate a new protocol version?**

A: Existing data is not affected. The protocol version primarily affects:
- Documentation and procedures
- What sites should follow going forward
- Regulatory submissions and compliance
- Audit trail for future reference

---

### Version Numbering Questions

**Q: What version number should I use for my first protocol?**

A: Use **1.0** for your initial protocol version. The system suggests this automatically.

---

**Q: When should I increment the major vs. minor version number?**

A:
- **Minor increment (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1):** Administrative changes, clarifications, minor amendments
- **Major increment (1.5 ‚Üí 2.0):** Significant changes to study design, major amendments, substantial modifications

---

**Q: Can I use three-part version numbers (1.0.1)?**

A: Currently, the system supports two-part version numbers (Major.Minor). If you need more granular tracking, use the description field to note sub-versions.

---

### Amendment Questions

**Q: When is regulatory approval required for an amendment?**

A:
- **MINOR amendments:** Usually internal approval only
- **MAJOR amendments:** FDA/EMA approval typically required
- **SUBSTANTIAL amendments:** Always require regulatory approval
- Check with your regulatory affairs team for specific requirements

---

**Q: How long does the amendment approval process take?**

A:
- **Internal review:** 1-10 business days (depends on amendment type)
- **FDA review:** 30 days (standard IND amendment)
- **EMA review:** 35-60 days
- **IRB/EC review:** 2-4 weeks
- Plan accordingly and build in buffer time

---

**Q: Can I have multiple amendments in review simultaneously?**

A: Yes, you can have multiple versions in PROTOCOL_REVIEW status. However, they must be activated sequentially - you cannot skip versions.

---

### Status Questions

**Q: Can I edit a version after submitting for review?**

A: No. Once submitted (status = PROTOCOL_REVIEW), the version is locked. If changes are needed:
1. Ask reviewer to reject back to DRAFT
2. Make your changes
3. Resubmit for review

---

**Q: What does SUPERSEDED status mean?**

A: SUPERSEDED means this version was previously active but has been replaced by a newer active version. It's kept as a historical record and cannot be edited or reactivated.

---

**Q: Can I revert to a previous protocol version?**

A: No direct revert. If you need to go back to a previous version:
1. Create a new amendment
2. Reference the previous version you want to restore
3. Go through the approval process
4. Activate the new version

---

### Permission Questions

**Q: Who can create protocol versions?**

A: Protocol Developers and Study Managers can create versions. Other roles can only view versions.

---

**Q: Who can approve protocol versions?**

A: Regulatory Affairs, Study Managers, and Principal Investigators can approve versions. Approval authority may vary by organization.

---

**Q: Can site staff view protocol versions?**

A: Yes, site staff (CRAs, Site Coordinators) can view all protocol versions but cannot create, edit, or approve them.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: Is version history preserved forever?**

A: Yes. All protocol versions are permanently stored for regulatory compliance and audit purposes. Even withdrawn versions remain in the system as read-only records.

---

**Q: Can I compare two protocol versions?**

A: Yes. The Version Comparison feature allows you to view side-by-side differences between any two versions. (Feature documentation coming soon)

---

**Q: How are sites notified of new protocol versions?**

A: When a version is activated:
1. Automatic email notifications sent to all site staff
2. Notification appears in site portal
3. Sites must acknowledge receipt
4. Training completion tracked (if required)

---

**Q: Can I export protocol version documentation?**

A: Yes. You can export:
- Individual version details (PDF)
- Complete version history (PDF/Excel)
- Change summary reports
- Regulatory submission packages
