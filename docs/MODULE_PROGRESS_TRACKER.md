- ✅ Business rules in PatientAggregate (DDD)
- ✅ Status transitions (REGISTERED → ENROLLED)
- ✅ API endpoints (`/clinops-ws/api/v1/patients`, `/patients/{id}/enroll`)
- ✅ Subject statistics dashboard

#### ⏳ What's In Progress (Week 2-4) (60% Remaining)
- ⏳ **Status management workflow** (Week 2 - SCREENING status handling)
- ⏳ **Screening workflow** (Week 2 - eligibility criteria evaluation)
- ⏳ **Subject visit scheduling** (Week 3 - visit timeline management)

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Fix Phase 6 blockers** (1-2 days)
   - Highest priority: Unblock Phase 6 completion
   - Required: Visit schedule bug + SQL migration

2. **Start Subject Management Week 1** (3-4 days)
   - Begin fixing study enrollment workflow
   - Critical for clinical operations
   - Foundation for all subsequent work

### Strategic Direction
1. **Focus on Subject Management for November**
   - Most critical missing piece for clinical workflows
   - Enables end-to-end patient enrollment → data capture flow
   - Required before Data Capture Module

2. **Parallel Frontend Development**
   - Phase 6F components can be built alongside Subject Management backend
   - Enables earlier user testing and feedback

3. **Integration Testing Priority**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for Study Design → Subject Management integration
   - Catch cross-module issues early

## 🎯 Decision: What's Next?

### ✅ **RECOMMENDATION: Subject Management (Patient Enrollment)**

**Rationale**:
1. **Natural Workflow**: Study designed → Subjects enrolled → Data captured
2. **Foundation Required**: Can't capture data without enrolled subjects
3. **25% Complete**: Infrastructure exists, just needs workflow implementation
4. **High Value**: Core clinical operations capability
5. **Feasible Timeline**: 4 weeks to complete Phase 1

**Alternative Considered**:
- Complete Phase 6F (Frontend) first
- **Decision**: Do Phase 6F in parallel, focus backend on Subject Management

---

## 📞 Next Meeting Topics

1. Review Phase 6 bug fixes (Visit Schedule + SQL)
2. Approve Subject Management Phase 1 plan
3. Assign resources for Subject Management implementation
4. Discuss Phase 6F frontend parallel track
5. Review integration testing strategy
