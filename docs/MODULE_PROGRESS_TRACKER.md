## 🎯 Current Focus: Study Design (Phase 6) + Subject Management

### Phase 6: Item-Level Metadata (Study Design Module)
**Status**: � 100% COMPLETE ✅  
**Started**: October 1, 2025  
**Completed**: October 11, 2025

#### Phase 6A-6E: REMOVED (Dead Code Elimination) ⚠️
**Status**: ❌ REMOVED - October 12, 2025  
**See**: `PHASE_6_BACKEND_NECESSITY_ANALYSIS.md`, `PHASE_6_BACKEND_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md`

**Why Removed**:
Phase 6A-6E backend was found to be **dead code** after comprehensive analysis:
1. ✅ CRF Builder already stores ALL metadata in form JSON (6 tabs)
2. ✅ Worker methods only created 2 dummy records per form (subject_id, visit_date)
3. ✅ Backend NEVER parsed actual form JSON to extract real metadata
4. ✅ Frontend NEVER called Phase 6 REST APIs (0 matches found in codebase)
5. ✅ Phase 6 tables contained FAKE DATA ONLY

**Architecture Decision**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Form JSON in FormDefinitionEntity
- **Query Strategy**: Postgres JSONB functions (performance: 15-150ms, sufficient)
- **No Functional Loss**: CRF Builder continues to work perfectly

**What Was Removed**:
- ❌ **Phase 6A**: Database schema (4 tables, 1 audit table, 2 triggers, 2 views, 6 indexes)
- ❌ **Phase 6B**: Worker service methods (createFieldMetadata, createCdashMappings, createMedicalCodingConfig)
- ❌ **Phase 6D**: REST API (StudyMetadataQueryController, 10 endpoints, 3 DTOs)
- ❌ **Phase 6E**: Service layer (StudyFieldMetadataService, 485 lines)
- ❌ **Total**: 13 backend files, 2,085+ lines of code (16.7% backend reduction)

**Database Removal**:
- ✅ SQL script created: `database/migrations/PHASE_6_BACKEND_REMOVAL.sql`
- ⏳ Pending: Manual execution of SQL script
- ⏳ Pending: Cleanup of consolidated_schema.sql and storeproc_and_function.sql

**What Remains** (Phase 6C + 6F):
- ✅ **Phase 6C**: Form Schema JSON Design (100%) - Used by CRF Builder
- ✅ **Phase 6F**: CRF Builder Enhancement (100%) - 6 metadata tabs + Export tab

#### In Progress 🔄
- 🐛 **Visit Schedule Bug Fix** (Backend)
  - 7 backend files modified (DTOs, commands, events, aggregates)
  - Missing: Compilation testing, runtime verification
  - Blocker: Medium priority

- 🐛 **Database Schema Fix** (study_medical_coding_config)
  - SQL script created for 8 missing columns
  - Missing: SQL execution
  - Blocker: Medium priority

#### Completed (Phase 6F) ✅
- ✅ **Phase 6F**: CRF Builder Enhancement (100%) - **COMPLETED Oct 12, 2025**
  - Duration: 4 hours (completed Oct 12, 2025)
  - **Approach**: Enhanced existing CRF Builder instead of creating separate components
  - **Avoided Duplication**: 2,310 lines of duplicate code eliminated (94.8% reduction)
  - Enhancement Implemented:
    * ✅ Added 7th "Export" tab to CRF Builder metadata panel
    * ✅ Export functions: JSON, CSV, Excel formats (3 formats)
    * ✅ Single field export with metadata summary
    * ✅ Bulk section export (all fields in CSV)
    * ✅ Export options: CDASH/SDTM, medical coding, validation rules, regulatory
  - **PHASE 6F COMPLETE - Single source of truth for all metadata**
  - **See**: `PHASE_6F_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md`, `PHASE_6F_ROLLBACK_AND_ENHANCEMENT_COMPLETE.md`

- ✅ Status transitions (REGISTERED → ENROLLED)
- ✅ API endpoints (`/clinops-ws/api/v1/patients`, `/patients/{id}/enroll`)
- ✅ Subject statistics dashboard

#### ⏳ What's In Progress (Week 2-4) (60% Remaining)
- ⏳ **Status management workflow** (Week 2 - SCREENING status handling)
- ⏳ **Screening workflow** (Week 2 - eligibility criteria evaluation)
- ⏳ **Subject visit scheduling** (Week 3 - visit timeline management)
- ⏳ **Visit compliance tracking** (Week 3 - missed visits, windows)

## 🎯 Decision: What's Next?

### ✅ **RECOMMENDATION: Subject Management (Patient Enrollment)**

**Rationale**:
1. **Natural Workflow**: Study designed → Subjects enrolled → Data captured
2. **Foundation Required**: Can't capture data without enrolled subjects
3. **25% Complete**: Infrastructure exists, just needs workflow implementation
4. **High Value**: Core clinical operations capability
5. **Feasible Timeline**: 4 weeks to complete Phase 1

**Alternative Considered**:
- Complete Phase 6F (Frontend) first
- **Decision**: Do Phase 6F in parallel, focus backend on Subject Management

---

## 📞 Next Meeting Topics

1. Review Phase 6 bug fixes (Visit Schedule + SQL)
2. Approve Subject Management Phase 1 plan
3. Assign resources for Subject Management implementation
