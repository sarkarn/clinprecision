# Session Summary: Status Change Workflow - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~4 hours  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

---

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully implemented and debugged a complete patient status change workflow with event sourcing, resolved critical transaction isolation deadlock issues, and made architectural decisions to separate status changes from form data collection.

---

## üìã Key Achievements

### 1. **Critical Bug Fix: Transaction Isolation Deadlock** ‚úÖ

**Problem Discovered:**
- Events were being emitted in aggregates but NOT persisted to event store
- INSERT statements generated but rolled back
- 5-30 second timeouts on all status changes and form submissions
- Silent failure - no error messages

**Root Cause Identified:**
```
@Transactional Method
‚îú‚îÄ Transaction START
‚îú‚îÄ commandGateway.send() ‚Üí INSERT event (uncommitted)
‚îú‚îÄ waitForProjection() starts polling
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Can't see uncommitted INSERT (READ COMMITTED isolation)
‚îú‚îÄ Timeout after 5-30 seconds
‚îú‚îÄ Exception thrown
‚îî‚îÄ Transaction ROLLBACK ‚Üí Event deleted from database
```

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed `@Transactional` from 4 services:
  1. `StudyFormDataService.submitFormData()` (line 69)
  2. `PatientStatusService` (class-level, line 70)
  3. `StudyDocumentCommandService` (class-level, line 22)
  4. `PatientEnrollmentService` (class-level, line 40)
- Let Axon Framework manage transactions internally
- Events now commit immediately, projections can see them

**Evidence:**
- BUILD SUCCESS at 16:37:15 (first 2 services)
- BUILD SUCCESS at 16:59:37 (final 2 services)
- Documentation: `TRANSACTION_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md`

---

### 2. **Database Schema Fixes** ‚úÖ

**Issue:** Missing columns causing audit trail failures

**Fixed:**
- `StudyFormDataAuditEntity.java`: Changed `@Column(name = "reason")` to `@Column(name = "change_reason")`
- Database columns added (via user):
  - `aggregate_uuid` VARCHAR(255)
  - `event_id` VARCHAR(255)

**Result:** Audit trail now works correctly for regulatory compliance

---

### 3. **Architectural Decision: Separation of Concerns** ‚úÖ

**Decision Made:** Remove form data collection from status change workflow

**Why:**
- Status changes should be fast, simple state transitions
- Form collection is data capture (different concern)
- Visit-based model aligns with clinical trial standards (ICH-GCP)
- Better flexibility, maintainability, and user experience

**Changes Implemented:**

**Frontend (Simplified):**
- ‚úÖ Removed `ScreeningAssessmentForm` integration from `StatusChangeModal.jsx`
- ‚úÖ Removed `FormDataService` import
- ‚úÖ Removed all form submission logic
- ‚úÖ Result: 50% less code, faster status changes

**Backend (Preserved):**
- ‚úÖ Kept all form data infrastructure (generic, reusable)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation comments to:
  - `FormDataAggregate.java`
  - `FormDataProjector.java`
  - `StudyFormDataService.java`
  - `StudyFormDataController.java`
- ‚úÖ Clarified use cases: Visit-based form collection (NOT status changes)

**Documentation Created:**
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STATUS_VS_FORMS.md` (~900 lines)
- Explains rationale, benefits, future integration (Week 3-4)

---

### 4. **Frontend UI Fixes** ‚úÖ

**Problems Fixed:**

**A. Status Not Updating in UI**
- Fixed `SubjectDetails.jsx`: Added missing `patientName` prop
- Fixed status format: Convert to uppercase for API (`SCREENING` not "Screening")
- Improved callback to refresh data after status change

**B. Wrong Endpoint (datacapture-ws ‚Üí clinops-ws)**
- Fixed `SubjectList.jsx`: Changed `/datacapture-ws/api/v1/patients` to `/clinops-ws/api/v1/patients`

**C. Status Display Issues**
- Fixed `SubjectList.jsx`: Show actual patient status (REGISTERED, SCREENING, ENROLLED, etc.)
- Previously showed "Registered Only" or "Enrolled" (based on studyId)
- Now shows proper status badges with correct colors

**D. Initial Load Behavior**
- Auto-load all registered patients on page load
- No need to click "Show All Registered Patients" button
- Users can see patients immediately

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. **Transaction Isolation is Critical in Event Sourcing**
- Don't wrap Axon command processing in Spring `@Transactional`
- Different threads = different transaction contexts
- INSERT in logs ‚â† committed to database
- `waitForProjection()` must run OUTSIDE transaction

### 2. **Separation of Concerns Matters**
- Status management ‚â† Data capture
- Visit-based model is industry standard
- Loose coupling enables flexibility
- Simpler code is better code

### 3. **Silent Failures are the Hardest**
- No error messages = longest debugging
- Thread names in logs were the key clue
- Database queries confirmed rollback behavior
- Multiple approaches needed to identify root cause

### 4. **Documentation is Essential**
- Future team members need context
- Architectural decisions should be recorded
- Comments prevent regression
- Code patterns should be explicit
