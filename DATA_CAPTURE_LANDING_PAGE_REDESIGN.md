# Data Capture Landing Page Redesign

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Branch:** CODE_REFACTORING_AND_TEST

---

## Overview

Redesigned the Data Capture module landing page (`DataCaptureDashboard.jsx`) to align with clinical data capture workflow and business process. The new dashboard provides actionable quick links, active study overview, and work queue visibility.

---

## Problem Statement

### Before (Issues Identified)

❌ **Limited Actionability** - Only one functional card with generic navigation  
❌ **Misleading Navigation** - "Subject Management" button navigated to different module  
❌ **Missing Key Workflows:**
   - Subject list by study
   - Visit management
   - Protocol deviation dashboard (newly built feature)
   - Data quality metrics
   
❌ **No Study Context** - No way to see/select active studies  
❌ **Generic Statistics** - Patient counts only, no actionable insights

### Clinical Workflow (Expected)

```
Patient Registry → Subject Enrollment → Visit Scheduling → Visit Execution → Form Data Entry
                                                                 ↓
                                                    Protocol Compliance Monitoring
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Structure

#### **A. Hero Header**
- Gradient blue header (professional clinical look)
- Clear module identification: "Data Capture & Entry"
- Subtitle: "Electronic Data Capture • Visit Management • Protocol Compliance"
- Branding: "ClinPrecision EDC"

#### **B. Overall Statistics Panel**
Enhanced patient statistics with gradient cards:
- **Total Patients** (Blue) - "Registered in System"
- **Enrolled Subjects** (Green) - "Active in Studies"
- **In Screening** (Yellow) - "Eligibility Assessment"
- **Completed** (Purple) - "Study Completion"

Each card includes:
- Large bold number (3xl font)
- Descriptive label
- Contextual subtitle
- Color-coded left border (4px)

#### **C. Quick Action Cards** (3 Cards)

**Card 1: Subject Management** (Blue)
- Icon: Users/People icon
- Description: "Enroll subjects, manage demographics, and track status"
- Mini Stats: Enrolled / Screening / Completed counts
- Actions:
  - **View All Subjects** (Primary - Blue button)
  - **Enroll New Subject** (Secondary - Border button)

**Card 2: Visit & Data Entry** (Green)
- Icon: Clipboard checklist
- Description: "Complete visits, enter form data, and track progress"
- Actions:
  - **View Subjects** (Primary - Green button)
  - **Patient Registry** (Secondary - Border button)

**Card 3: Protocol Compliance** (Red)
- Icon: Shield check
- Description: "Track deviations, visit windows, and protocol adherence"
- Actions:
  - **Protocol Deviations** (Primary - Red button) → NEW FEATURE!
  - **View Subjects** (Secondary - Border button)

#### **D. Active Studies Grid**
Shows up to 6 active/recruiting studies with:
- Study name (title or name field)
- Protocol number
- Status badge (ACTIVE/RECRUITING/PUBLISHED)
- Enrollment progress:
  - Blue card: Enrolled subjects count
  - Gray card: Target enrollment count
- Phase indicator
- **Clickable cards** → Navigate to Subject List with preselected study
- "View Subjects →" quick action button
- "View All X Active Studies" link (if >6 studies)

Empty State:
- Clipboard icon
- "No Active Studies" message
- Help text

#### **E. Work Queue Section**
Placeholder for future implementation:
- Pending visits
- Overdue data entry
- Protocol deviations requiring attention

Current Empty State:
- Clipboard checkmark icon
- "No Pending Tasks" message
- Quick action buttons:
  - **View Subjects** (Primary)
  - **View Deviations** (Secondary)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. **DataCaptureDashboard.jsx** (Complete Rewrite)

**New Imports:**
```javascript
import { getStudies } from '../../../services/StudyService';
```

**New State:**
```javascript
const [activeStudies, setActiveStudies] = useState([]);
```

**Enhanced Data Loading:**
```javascript
const loadDashboardData = async () => {
    // Load patient statistics
    const stats = await PatientEnrollmentService.getPatientStatistics();
    setPatientStats(stats);

    // Load active studies
    const studies = await getStudies();
    const active = studies.filter(s => 
        s.status === 'ACTIVE' || s.status === 'RECRUITING' || s.status === 'PUBLISHED'
    );
    setActiveStudies(active);
};
```

**Key Features:**
- Gradient header with professional styling
- 4 enhanced statistic cards with gradients and descriptions
- 3 quick action cards with icons, stats, and dual action buttons
- Active studies grid with enrollment progress
- Clickable study cards with navigation
- Work queue placeholder with quick actions
- Loading spinner during data fetch

**Navigation Enhancements:**
- Study card click → Navigate to `/datacapture-management/subjects` with `{ state: { preselectedStudy: study.id } }`
- Protocol Deviations button → Navigate to `/datacapture-management/deviations/dashboard`
- All navigation uses module-relative paths (`/datacapture-management/*`)

#### 2. **SubjectList.jsx** (Enhancement)

**Added Preselected Study Support:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // Check if study was preselected from navigation state (e.g., from dashboard)
    if (location.state?.preselectedStudy) {
        console.log('[SUBJECT LIST] Preselected study from navigation:', location.state.preselectedStudy);
        setSelectedStudy(location.state.preselectedStudy);
        // Clear the navigation state to prevent re-selection on refresh
        window.history.replaceState({}, document.title);
    }
}, [location.state]);
```

**Benefits:**
- Dashboard study cards can directly navigate to subject list with study pre-selected
- Reduces user clicks (no need to manually select study)
- Clears navigation state after use (prevents stale preselection on refresh)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before vs After

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Study Selection** | No study context visible | Up to 6 active studies visible with stats |
| **Quick Actions** | 3 generic buttons in 1 card | 6 targeted actions across 3 cards |
| **Statistics** | Generic patient counts | Enhanced with context and visual hierarchy |

## Future Enhancements

### Work Queue Implementation

**Planned Features:**
1. **Pending Visits** - Visits scheduled but not completed
2. **Overdue Visits** - Visits outside visit window
3. **Forms Awaiting Verification** - Data entry completed, needs verification
4. **Protocol Deviations Requiring Action** - Open/Under Review deviations
5. **Data Queries** - Outstanding queries needing resolution

**API Requirements:**
- `GET /api/v1/visits/pending?studyId={id}` - Pending visits
- `GET /api/v1/visits/overdue?studyId={id}` - Overdue visits
- `GET /api/v1/forms/pending-verification?studyId={id}` - Forms needing verification
- `GET /api/v1/protocol-deviations/requiring-action` - Open deviations

### Additional Metrics

**Planned Statistics:**
1. **Data Entry Progress** - % forms completed per study
2. **Visit Compliance** - % visits completed within window
3. **Query Resolution Rate** - % queries resolved vs open
4. **Deviation Trend** - Deviations per month (chart)
