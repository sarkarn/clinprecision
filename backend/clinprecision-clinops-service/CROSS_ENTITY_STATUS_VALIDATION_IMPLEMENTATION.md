# Cross-Entity Status Dependency Validation Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **Cross-Entity Status Dependency Validation** system that has been successfully implemented as **Item 3** from the Study Versioning & Amendments gap analysis. This system validates consistency between study status and related entities (protocol versions and amendments) across all status transitions.

## Implementation Components

### 1. CrossEntityStatusValidationService

**File**: `src/main/java/com/clinprecision/studydesignservice/service/CrossEntityStatusValidationService.java`

**Purpose**: Central service for validating dependencies between study status and related entities

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive validation for all study status transitions
- Status-specific validation methods for each study state
- Detailed error reporting and warnings
- Validation metadata and details collection

**Core Method**:
```java
public CrossEntityValidationResult validateCrossEntityDependencies(StudyEntity study, String targetStatus, String operation)
```

**Validation Categories**:
- **Protocol Version Consistency**: Ensures protocol versions are in appropriate states for study status
- **Amendment Status Validation**: Validates amendment statuses align with study lifecycle
- **Cross-Entity Dependencies**: Checks relationships between study, versions, and amendments
- **Safety Amendment Priority**: Special handling for safety-critical amendments
- **Status Transition Rules**: Enforces business rules for status changes

### 2. Status-Specific Validation Methods

#### 2.1 validateDraftStatus()
- Validates studies in DRAFT status
- Checks for proper initialization of protocol versions
- Ensures no conflicting amendments exist

#### 2.2 validateActiveStatus()
- Validates studies in ACTIVE status
- Requires at least one ACTIVE protocol version
- Checks for pending safety amendments requiring attention
- Validates enrollment status consistency

#### 2.3 validateSuspendedStatus()
- Validates studies in SUSPENDED status
- Checks for pending safety amendments requiring review
- Ensures proper suspension documentation

#### 2.4 validateCompletedStatus()
- Validates studies in COMPLETED status
- Requires all protocol versions to be in final states
- Ensures no ongoing amendments
- Validates completion documentation

#### 2.5 validateTerminatedStatus()
- Validates studies in TERMINATED status
- Requires termination documentation amendment
- Ensures pending amendments are resolved
- Validates proper closure procedures

#### 2.6 validateWithdrawnStatus()
- Validates studies in WITHDRAWN status
- Requires withdrawal documentation amendment
- Ensures proper withdrawal procedures

### 3. Integration with StudyService

**Enhanced StudyService**: 
- Added `CrossEntityStatusValidationService` as a dependency
- Integrated cross-entity validation into `validateCrossEntityConsistency()` method
- Added public method `validateStudyCrossEntity()` for external validation access

**Validation Flow**:
```java
private void validateCrossEntityConsistency(StudyEntity study, String operation) {
    CrossEntityValidationResult result = crossEntityValidationService
        .validateCrossEntityDependencies(study, studyStatus, operation);
    
    // Handle validation errors and warnings
    if (!result.getErrors().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cross-entity validation failures");
    }
}
```

### 4. REST API Endpoint

**New Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/studies/{studyId}/status/validate-cross-entity`

**Purpose**: Provides external access to cross-entity validation

**Parameters**:
- `studyId` (required): ID of the study to validate
- `targetStatus` (optional): Target status for transition validation
- `operation` (optional): Operation being performed (default: "validation")

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "studyId": 123,
  "targetStatus": "ACTIVE",
  "operation": "status_change",
  "valid": true,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": ["Warning message"],
  "errorCount": 0,
  "warningCount": 1,
  "validationDetails": {
    "protocolVersions": 2,
    "activeVersions": 1,
    "pendingAmendments": 0
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

### 5. CrossEntityValidationResult

**Purpose**: Structured result object for validation outcomes

**Properties**:
- `valid`: Boolean indicating overall validation success
- `errors`: List of validation errors that prevent operation
- `warnings`: List of warnings that don't prevent operation
- `validationDetails`: Map of detailed validation metadata
- `errorCount`: Number of errors found
- `warningCount`: Number of warnings found

## Validation Rules Implemented

### Study Status Transition Rules

1. **DRAFT → ACTIVE**:
   - Must have at least one APPROVED protocol version
   - No conflicting amendments in REJECTED status
   - All safety amendments must be resolved

2. **ACTIVE → SUSPENDED**:
   - Must document suspension reason
   - Safety amendments require immediate attention
   - Ongoing enrollments must be handled

3. **SUSPENDED → ACTIVE**:
   - Must resolve suspension issues
   - Safety amendments must be addressed
   - Protocol versions must be consistent

4. **ACTIVE → COMPLETED**:
   - All protocol versions must be in final states
   - No pending amendments allowed
   - Must have completion documentation

5. **Any Status → TERMINATED**:
   - Must have termination documentation amendment
   - All pending amendments must be resolved
   - Proper closure procedures required

6. **Any Status → WITHDRAWN**:
   - Must have withdrawal documentation amendment
   - Proper withdrawal procedures required

### Amendment Status Consistency Rules

1. **Safety Amendments**: Priority handling across all study states
2. **Administrative Amendments**: Standard processing rules
3. **Protocol Amendments**: Must align with protocol version states
4. **Status Validation**: Amendment status must be consistent with study lifecycle

### Protocol Version Consistency Rules

1. **Active Studies**: Must have at least one ACTIVE protocol version
2. **Completed Studies**: All versions must be in final states (COMPLETED/ARCHIVED)
3. **Version Sequencing**: Proper version numbering and effective dates
4. **Amendment Alignment**: Amendments must target appropriate version states

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors (Blocking)
- Missing required protocol versions
- Conflicting amendment statuses
- Invalid status transitions
- Missing required documentation

### Validation Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Pending safety amendments in active studies
- Multiple versions with same effective date
- Recommendations for best practices

### Exception Handling
- Service-level exception handling with proper logging
- Controller-level error responses with detailed messages
- Graceful degradation for validation failures

## Integration Points

### 1. StudyService Integration
- Automatic validation during all study operations
- Integrated into existing validation framework
- Consistent error handling and logging

### 2. StudyStatusController Integration
- New validation endpoint for external access
- Consistent response format with other endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes for validation results

### 3. Entity Relationships
- Leverages existing JPA relationships
- Efficient querying of related entities
- Proper handling of optional relationships

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. **Valid Transitions**: All supported status transitions with proper setup
2. **Invalid Transitions**: Blocked transitions with detailed error messages
3. **Edge Cases**: Complex scenarios with multiple amendments and versions
4. **Safety Amendments**: Priority handling and validation
5. **Documentation Requirements**: Validation of required documentation amendments

### Validation Outcomes
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All study statuses and transitions validated
- **Detailed Reporting**: Clear error messages and warnings
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient entity queries and validation logic
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new validation rules and scenarios

## Usage Examples

### 1. Programmatic Validation
```java
CrossEntityValidationResult result = studyService
    .validateStudyCrossEntity(studyId, "ACTIVE", "status_change");

if (!result.isValid()) {
    // Handle validation errors
    logger.error("Validation failed: {}", result.getErrors());
}
```

### 2. REST API Validation
```bash
POST /api/v1/studies/123/status/validate-cross-entity
?studyId=123&targetStatus=ACTIVE&operation=status_change
```

### 3. Automatic Validation
- Automatically triggered during study operations
- Integrated into existing validation pipeline
- No additional configuration required
