   - Categorizes organizations (Sponsor, CRO, Site, etc.)
   - Contains name, code, and description
   - One-to-many relationship with organizations

3. **SiteEntity.java**
   - Represents clinical trial sites
   - Contains site number, address, and status
   - Relationships to organizations, principal investigators, and studies

4. **UserTypeEntity.java**
   - Defines types of users in the system
   - Categorizes users by role (CRA, PI, Data Manager, etc.)
   - Includes category enumeration for broader classification

5. **UserQualificationEntity.java**
   - Manages user certifications and credentials
   - Tracks issuance, expiration, and verification status
   - Associates qualifications with specific users

6. **UserStudyRoleEntity.java**
   - Defines user roles within specific studies
   - Tracks role assignments with start/end dates
   - Supports different statuses (active, inactive, suspended, pending)

7. **UserSiteAssignmentEntity.java**
   - Associates users with specific clinical sites
   - Defines user roles at sites
   - Tracks assignment periods and status

8. **UserSessionEntity.java**
   - Tracks user login sessions
   - Records IP, user agent, and device information
   - Manages session status (active, expired, logged out)

9. **OrganizationContactEntity.java**
   - Manages contacts for organizations
   - Includes contact details and type
   - Supports primary contact designation

10. **OrganizationStudyEntity.java**
    - Defines organization roles in studies
    - Tracks organization involvement periods
    - Supports different statuses for involvement

11. **SiteStudyEntity.java**
    - Associates sites with specific studies
    - Tracks site activation and enrollment information
    - Manages site status within studies

## Database Relationships

- **User to Organization**: Many-to-one (each user can belong to one organization)
- **User to User Types**: Many-to-many (users can have multiple types)
- **Organization to Organization Type**: Many-to-one (each organization has one type)
- **Site to Organization**: Many-to-one (sites belong to organizations)
- **User to Qualifications**: One-to-many (users can have multiple qualifications)
- **User to Study Roles**: One-to-many (users can have roles in multiple studies)
- **User to Site Assignments**: One-to-many (users can be assigned to multiple sites)
- **Site to Principal Investigator**: Many-to-one (each site has one PI)
- **User to Sessions**: One-to-many (users can have multiple login sessions)
- **Organization to Contacts**: One-to-many (organizations can have multiple contacts)
- **Organization to Studies**: One-to-many (organizations can be involved in multiple studies)
- **Site to Studies**: One-to-many (sites can participate in multiple studies)

## Enum Types Implemented

- **OrganizationEntity.OrganizationStatus**: active, inactive, suspended
- **SiteEntity.SiteStatus**: active, inactive, pending, suspended
- **UserTypeEntity.UserCategory**: SPONSOR_USER, CRO_USER, SITE_USER, VENDOR_USER, SUBJECT_USER, SYSTEM_USER
- **UserQualificationEntity.VerificationStatus**: PENDING, VERIFIED, REJECTED, EXPIRED
- **UserStudyRoleEntity.RoleStatus**: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING
- **UserSiteAssignmentEntity.AssignmentStatus**: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING
- **UserSessionEntity.SessionStatus**: ACTIVE, EXPIRED, LOGGED_OUT, INVALIDATED
- **OrganizationContactEntity.ContactType**: GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL, BILLING, CLINICAL, SCIENTIFIC, REGULATORY
- **OrganizationStudyEntity.OrganizationStudyStatus**: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, PENDING
- **SiteStudyEntity.SiteStudyStatus**: PENDING, ACTIVE, INACTIVE, CLOSED, SUSPENDED

## Database Schema

The database schema has been created in `user_organization_model.sql` with:
- Tables for all entity types
- Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Default values for status fields
- Timestamp fields for audit purposes (created_at, updated_at)
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate data
- Default data for organization types and user types

## Next Steps

1. Create repository interfaces for each entity
2. Implement service layer components
3. Develop controller endpoints for API access
4. Implement security and access control
5. Create DTOs for data transfer
6. Develop unit and integration tests
7. Update frontend components to work with the new data model
