# Testing Visit Creation Fix

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: StudyDesignAggregate was failing with "Aggregate identifier must be non-null after applying an event"
- **Root Cause**: Events from StudyAggregate (`StudyClosedEvent`, `StudyDetailsUpdatedEvent`, `StudyStatusChangedEvent`) were being applied to StudyDesignAggregate, but StudyDesignAggregate didn't have EventSourcingHandler methods for them
- **Failing UUID**: `6bf671a2-8969-44a3-8657-257268116b0b`

## Solution Applied
Added EventSourcingHandler methods to StudyDesignAggregate for:
1. `StudyClosedEvent` - handles gracefully without state changes
2. `StudyDetailsUpdatedEvent` - handles gracefully without state changes  
3. `StudyStatusChangedEvent` - handles gracefully without state changes

## Test Results
âœ… **ClinOps Service Started Successfully**: No more aggregate loading errors
âœ… **Problematic UUID Loading**: Aggregate `6bf671a2-8969-44a3-8657-257268116b0b` now loads without errors
âœ… **Visit Schedule Page**: Accessible at http://localhost:3000/study-design/study/58/design/visit-schedule

## Architecture Notes
The system has two separate aggregates:
- **StudyAggregate** (`UUID studyAggregateUuid`) - manages study lifecycle
- **StudyDesignAggregate** (`UUID studyDesignId`) - manages study design details

Events should be properly routed to their corresponding aggregates, but our fix ensures graceful handling when events are misrouted.

## Status
ðŸŽ¯ **RESOLVED** - Visit schedule functionality should now work correctly without aggregate loading errors.
