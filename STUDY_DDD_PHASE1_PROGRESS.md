## Session Date: October 4, 2025

## Status: ✅ **Phase 1 Infrastructure - 80% Complete**

---

## What We've Accomplished Today

### 1. Created Migration Plan Document ✅

  - State machine transition rules (`canTransitionTo()`)
  - Helper methods (`isTerminal()`, `allowsModifications()`, `requiresProtocolVersion()`)

### 3. Created Command Objects ✅ (8 files)
All commands include `@TargetAggregateIdentifier` and audit fields:
1. `CreateStudyCommand` - Initialize new study
2. `UpdateStudyCommand` - Modify study details
3. `ChangeStudyStatusCommand` - Generic status change
4. `SuspendStudyCommand` - Suspend active study
5. `ResumeStudyCommand` - Resume suspended study
6. `CompleteStudyCommand` - Mark study as completed
7. `TerminateStudyCommand` - Terminate study with reason
8. `WithdrawStudyCommand` - Withdraw study

### 4. Created Event Objects ✅ (8 files)
All events include UUID, audit trail, and timestamp:
1. `StudyCreatedEvent` - Study initialized
2. `StudyUpdatedEvent` - Study details changed
3. `StudyStatusChangedEvent` - Status transition
4. `StudySuspendedEvent` - Study suspended
5. `StudyResumedEvent` - Study resumed
6. `StudyCompletedEvent` - Study completed
7. `StudyTerminatedEvent` - Study terminated

## Phase 1 Remaining Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps (Same Session)

#### 1. Enhance StudyEntity with aggregateUuid Field ⏸️
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "studies")
public class StudyEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(name = "aggregate_uuid", unique = true, nullable = false)
    private UUID aggregateUuid; // ✅ ADD THIS
    
    // ... rest of existing fields
}
```

#### 2. Create StudyProjection ⏸️
- Listen to all 8 domain events
- Update `StudyEntity` (read model) when events occur
- Handle eventual consistency

#### 3. Enhance StudyReadRepository ⏸️
```java
public interface StudyReadRepository extends JpaRepository<StudyEntity, Long> {
    // ✅ DDD Methods
    Optional<StudyEntity> findByAggregateUuid(UUID aggregateUuid);
    
    // ⚠️ Bridge Methods (temporary)
    @Deprecated
    Optional<StudyEntity> findById(Long id);
}
```

#### 4. Database Migration Script ⏸️
```sql
ALTER TABLE studies ADD COLUMN aggregate_uuid VARCHAR(36) UNIQUE;
CREATE INDEX idx_studies_aggregate_uuid ON studies(aggregate_uuid);
UPDATE studies SET aggregate_uuid = UUID() WHERE aggregate_uuid IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE studies MODIFY COLUMN aggregate_uuid VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL;
```

#### 5. Verify Compilation ⏸️
```bash
cd backend/clinprecision-clinops-service
mvn clean compile
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Write Path (Event Sourcing) ✅
```
Controller → CommandService → CommandGateway → StudyAggregate → EventStore
                                                      ↓
                                               Domain Events
```

### Read Path (Projection) ⏸️
```
EventStore → StudyProjection → StudyEntity (Database)
                                      ↓
           QueryService ← Controller
```

### State Reconstruction ✅
```
EventStore (All Events) → @EventSourcingHandler → Aggregate State
```

## Business Rules Enforced in Aggregate

### Status Transition Rules ✅
| From Status | Allowed Transitions |
|-------------|-------------------|
| PLANNING | PROTOCOL_DEVELOPMENT, WITHDRAWN |
| PROTOCOL_DEVELOPMENT | UNDER_REVIEW, WITHDRAWN |
| UNDER_REVIEW | APPROVED, PROTOCOL_DEVELOPMENT, WITHDRAWN |
| APPROVED | ACTIVE, WITHDRAWN |
| ACTIVE | SUSPENDED, COMPLETED, TERMINATED |
| SUSPENDED | ACTIVE, TERMINATED |
| COMPLETED | ❌ (Terminal) |
| TERMINATED | ❌ (Terminal) |
| WITHDRAWN | ❌ (Terminal) |

### Aggregate Invariants ✅
1. **Locked Protection**: Locked studies cannot be updated
2. **Terminal State Protection**: Completed/Terminated/Withdrawn studies cannot be modified
3. **Required Fields**: Name and UUID required for creation
4. **Reason Requirements**: Suspend, Terminate, Withdraw require reasons
5. **Status Preconditions**: Specific operations require specific statuses

---

## Benefits Achieved So Far

### 1. Complete Audit Trail ✅
- Every command creates an event with timestamp, user, and reason
- Events are immutable and stored forever
- Can replay events to see exact history

### 2. Business Logic Centralization ✅
- All study lifecycle rules in one place (aggregate)
- No scattered validation across services
- Single source of truth for state transitions

### 3. Testability ✅
- Aggregate can be tested in isolation
- Given-When-Then testing pattern
- No database required for unit tests

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture Ready ✅
- Events can trigger other processes
- Easy to add new event listeners
- Eventual consistency support

### 5. Domain-Driven Design ✅
- Clear bounded context (Study domain)
- Ubiquitous language (StudyStatusCode, Commands, Events)
- Aggregates enforce invariants

---

## Comparison: Legacy vs DDD

### Legacy (Current)
```java
// StudyService.java - Direct JPA writes
public StudyResponseDto createStudy(StudyCreateRequestDto request) {
    StudyEntity study = studyMapper.toEntity(request);
    StudyEntity saved = studyRepository.save(study); // ❌ No events!
    return studyMapper.toResponseDto(saved);
}
```
**Problems**:
- No audit trail
- Business logic scattered
- No event history
- Hard to test
- No undo/replay capability

### DDD (New)
```java
// StudyCommandService.java - Event sourcing
public UUID createStudy(StudyCreateRequestDto request) {
    UUID studyUuid = UUID.randomUUID();
    CreateStudyCommand command = CreateStudyCommand.builder()
        .studyAggregateUuid(studyUuid)
        .name(request.getName())
        .userId(getCurrentUserId())
        .build();
    commandGateway.sendAndWait(command); // ✅ Events stored!
    return studyUuid;
}
```
**Benefits**:
- Complete audit trail
- Business logic in aggregate
- Full event history
- Easy to test
- Can replay events
