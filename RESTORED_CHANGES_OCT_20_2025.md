# Restored Changes - October 20, 2025

## Summary
This document lists all the changes that were restored after an accidental rollback on October 20, 2025.

## Changes Restored

### 1. **Study Create & Edit - Field Mapping Issues Fixed** ‚úÖ

#### Problem
Many fields from the frontend Study Create/Edit forms were not being saved to the database because they were missing from:
- Command objects (CreateStudyCommand, UpdateStudyCommand)
- Events (StudyCreatedEvent, StudyUpdatedEvent)  
- Aggregate (StudyAggregate)
- Mapper (StudyCommandMapper)
- Projection (StudyProjection)

#### Solution - Added Missing Fields Throughout the CQRS Pipeline

**Fields Added:**
- `organizationId` - Organization selection
- `objective` - Study objective
- `targetSites` - Target number of sites
- `plannedStartDate` - Planned start date
- `plannedEndDate` - Planned end date
- `blinding` - Blinding type
- `randomization` - Randomization strategy
- `controlType` - Control type
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `riskLevel` - Risk level classification
- `studyStatusId` - For update command
- `version` - Protocol version
- `isLatestVersion` - Version flag

---

### 2. **Organization Dropdown - Feign Client Integration** ‚úÖ

#### Files Created/Modified

**NEW FILE:** `OrganizationServiceClient.java`
```
Location: backend/clinprecision-clinops-service/src/main/java/com/clinprecision/clinopsservice/client/
Purpose: Feign client to fetch organizations from organization-service
```

**NEW FILE:** `OrganizationProxyController.java`
```
Location: backend/clinprecision-clinops-service/src/main/java/com/clinprecision/clinopsservice/controller/
Purpose: Proxy controller to expose organization endpoints through clinops-service
Endpoints:
  - GET /api/organizations - Get all organizations
  - GET /api/organizations/{id} - Get organization by ID
```

This allows the frontend to fetch organizations for dropdown without calling organization-service directly.

---

### 3. **Protocol Version Fields** ‚úÖ

#### Updated Files

**StudyUpdateRequestDto.java**
- Added `organizationId` field to allow updating organization on study edit

**CreateStudyCommand.java**
- Added complete field mapping including:
  - organizationId
  - All date fields (startDate, endDate, plannedStartDate, plannedEndDate)
  - Version fields (version, isLatestVersion)
  - Classification fields (blinding, randomization, controlType)
  - Additional fields (notes, riskLevel, objective, targetSites)

**UpdateStudyCommand.java**  
- Added all same fields as CreateStudyCommand
- Added studyStatusId for status updates

**StudyAggregate.java**
- Added all new fields to aggregate state
- Updated CreateStudyCommand handler to map all fields to StudyCreatedEvent
- Updated UpdateStudyCommand handler to map all fields to StudyUpdatedEvent
- Updated event sourcing handlers to rebuild state from events

**StudyCreatedEvent.java**
- Added all new fields to capture complete study state

**StudyUpdatedEvent.java**
- Added all new fields for partial updates

**StudyCommandMapper.java**
- Updated `toCreateCommand()` to map ALL fields from DTO to command
- Updated `toUpdateCommand()` to map ALL fields from DTO to command

**StudyProjection.java**
- Updated `on(StudyCreatedEvent)` to save version fields and targetSites
- Updated `on(StudyUpdatedEvent)` to update version fields and targetSites
- Added comments noting which fields are in events but not yet in database schema

---

### 4. **Organization Service API Fix** ‚úÖ

#### Problem
Frontend `OrganizationService.js` was calling `/organization-ws/api/organizations` directly, causing infinite loop/flickering in Study Edit dropdown because:
- Direct service-to-service calls not configured properly
- API calls failing/timing out
- useEffect retrying continuously

#### Solution
Updated `OrganizationService.js` to use the clinops-service proxy endpoints:
- Changed: `/organization-ws/api/organizations` 
- To: `/clinops-ws/api/organizations`
- This routes through `OrganizationProxyController` which uses `OrganizationServiceClient` Feign client

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/clinprecision/src/services/OrganizationService.js`
  - Updated `getAllOrganizations()` method
  - Updated `getOrganizationById()` method
- `frontend/clinprecision/src/services/StudyOrganizationService.js`
   - NEW study-specific proxy service consuming clinops-service bridge
- `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/study-creation/steps/BasicInformationStep.jsx`
   - Fixed default organization prop to prevent infinite effect loops
   - Continue to fall back to StudyOrganizationService when no data passed
- `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/study-creation/StudyEditWizard.jsx`
   - Passes hydrated organization list down to BasicInformationStep to avoid redundant fetches

## Files Modified

### Backend - Study Management Module

3. **Aggregate:**
   - `StudyAggregate.java` - Added 20+ new state fields, updated command handlers and event sourcing handlers

4. **DTOs:**
   - `StudyUpdateRequestDto.java` - Added organizationId field

5. **Mappers:**
   - `StudyCommandMapper.java` - Updated both toCreateCommand() and toUpdateCommand() methods

6. **Projections:**
   - `StudyProjection.java` - Updated both event handlers to save new fields

7. **Feign Clients (NEW):**

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Study Create
- Create a new study with all fields populated
- Verify all fields are saved to database
- Check organization dropdown loads correctly

### 2. Test Study Update  
- Update an existing study
- Verify partial updates work (only provided fields updated)
- Verify version fields are preserved

### 3. Test Organization Dropdown
- Verify `/api/organizations` endpoint returns organizations
- Verify dropdown populates in frontend

### 4. Test Protocol Version Fields
- Verify version field is saved correctly
- Verify isLatestVersion flag works
- Test version management functionality

## Database Schema Notes

**Fields in Events but NOT Yet in StudyEntity Table:**
The following fields are now in commands/events/aggregate but NOT yet in the database schema:
- `objective` 
- `blinding`
- `randomization`
- `controlType`
- `notes` (may exist as versionNotes)
- `riskLevel`
- `plannedStartDate`
- `plannedEndDate`
- Direct `organizationId` column (uses junction table instead)

**These fields will need database migration scripts to be fully functional.**

Currently these values are:
‚úÖ Captured in events (event store)
‚úÖ Maintained in aggregate state (event sourcing)
‚ùå Not persisted in read model (StudyEntity table)

---

## Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
1. All form fields from frontend are captured in commands
2. All fields are stored in event sourcing (event store)
3. Aggregate state is complete
4. Organization dropdown integration works
5. Version fields (version, isLatestVersion) are saved
6. Field mapping is complete throughout CQRS pipeline

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Database Schema Update
Fields that exist in domain model but not in database:
- objective
- blinding
- randomization  
- controlType
- notes (if different from versionNotes)
- riskLevel
- plannedStartDate
- plannedEndDate
- Direct organizationId column (currently uses junction table)

### üîÑ Migration Path
1. Create database migration scripts for missing columns
2. Update StudyEntity.java to add @Column annotations
3. Update StudyProjection.java to save the new fields
4. Test end-to-end
