---

## 📁 Files Created So Far (16 files)

### 1. Domain Layer - Value Objects (4 files) ✅

- ✅ `VersionStatus.java` - Status lifecycle with transition rules

- ✅ `VersionNumber.java` - Semantic version number with validation

### 2. Domain Layer - Commands (6 files) ✅

- ✅ `CreateProtocolVersionCommand.java` - Create new version
- ✅ `ChangeVersionStatusCommand.java` - **Replaces triggers!**
- ✅ `ApproveVersionCommand.java` - Regulatory approval
- ✅ `ActivateVersionCommand.java` - Activate version (supersede previous)
- ✅ `UpdateVersionDetailsCommand.java` - Update version details
- ✅ `WithdrawVersionCommand.java` - Withdraw/cancel version

### 3. Domain Layer - Events (6 files) ✅

- ✅ `ProtocolVersionCreatedEvent.java` - Version created
- ✅ `VersionStatusChangedEvent.java` - **Status change audit trail**

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Status Transition Rules**

```
DRAFT → UNDER_REVIEW, SUBMITTED, WITHDRAWN
UNDER_REVIEW → DRAFT, AMENDMENT_REVIEW, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, WITHDRAWN
AMENDMENT_REVIEW → UNDER_REVIEW, APPROVED, WITHDRAWN
SUBMITTED → APPROVED, UNDER_REVIEW, WITHDRAWN
APPROVED → ACTIVE, WITHDRAWN
ACTIVE → SUPERSEDED, WITHDRAWN
SUPERSEDED, WITHDRAWN → (terminal states)
```

### 2. **Amendment Type Business Rules**

```java
AmendmentType.MAJOR.requiresRegulatoryApproval()  // true
AmendmentType.SAFETY.requiresRegulatoryApproval() // true
AmendmentType.MINOR.requiresRegulatoryApproval()  // false
AmendmentType.ADMINISTRATIVE.requiresRegulatoryApproval() // false
```

### 3. **Version Numbering**

- Semantic versioning pattern: `1.0`, `v2.1`, `1.0.0`
- Max 20 characters
- Regex validation: `^v?\\d+(\\.\\d+)*$`

   - `ProtocolVersionReadRepository.java` - Query repository

3. **Application Layer** (2 files) - 🔴 NOT STARTED
   - `ProtocolVersionCommandService.java`
   - `ProtocolVersionQueryService.java`

4. **API Layer** (7+ files) - 🔴 NOT STARTED
   - DTOs (5-6 files)
   - Controllers (2 files)

5. **Database Migration** (1 file) - 🔴 NOT STARTED
   - Add `aggregate_uuid` column to `study_versions` table
   - Migration script

6. **Trigger Removal** (1 file) - 🔴 NOT STARTED
   - SQL script to disable/drop triggers
   - Documentation of removed triggers

## 🔑 Business Rules Implemented

### Version Status Rules
- ✅ Status transition validation
- ✅ Editable states: DRAFT, UNDER_REVIEW
- ✅ Terminal states: SUPERSEDED, WITHDRAWN
- ✅ Review states: UNDER_REVIEW, AMENDMENT_REVIEW

### Amendment Rules
- ✅ Amendment reason required when type specified
- ✅ Major/Safety amendments require regulatory approval
- ✅ Priority levels: Safety (1), Major (2), Minor (3), Administrative (4)

### Approval Rules
- ✅ Effective date cannot be in the past
- ✅ Approved by user ID required
- ✅ Approval comments captured

### Activation Rules
- ✅ Activation reason required
- ✅ Previous active version tracked
- ✅ Only approved versions can be activated

| Aspect | Study Module | Protocol Version Module |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Value Objects | 4 files | 4 files ✅ |
| Commands | 4 files | 6 files ✅ (more complex workflow) |
| Events | 4 files | 6 files ✅ |
| Aggregate | 1 file (338 lines) | 1 file (pending) |
| Total Commands | 4 | 6 |
| Status Transitions | 9 statuses | 8 statuses |
| Complexity | Medium | High (approval workflow) |

## 🎓 Lessons from Phase 1

### Applied Best Practices
- ✅ Value Objects with business logic
- ✅ Rich enums with behavior methods
- ✅ Factory methods for event creation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation in commands
- ✅ Immutable event design
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Enhanced for Phase 2
- ✅ More complex workflow (approval, activation)

   - Complex approval/activation logic

2. **Create Projection & Entity** (20 min)
   - Event handlers for read model
   - JPA entity with aggregate_uuid
   - Repository interface

3. **Create Services** (15 min)
   - Command service
   - Query service

4. **Create API Layer** (20 min)
   - DTOs
   - Controllers

5. **Database Migration** (10 min)
   - ALTER TABLE script
   - Index creation

6. **Trigger Analysis & Removal** (15 min)
   - Identify all triggers
   - Create removal script
   - Document replaced logic

**Estimated Time to Complete Phase 2: 2-2.5 hours**

## 🔍 Database Triggers to Remove

### Triggers Affecting Protocol Versions (from Phase 1 analysis)

1. `update_study_status_on_version` - Fires when version created
2. `update_study_status_on_version_status` - Fires on version status change
3. `update_version_effective_date` - Auto-updates effective dates
4. `notify_stakeholders_on_approval` - Sends notifications
5. Additional triggers TBD (need database inspection)

**All of these will be replaced by explicit commands and events!**
