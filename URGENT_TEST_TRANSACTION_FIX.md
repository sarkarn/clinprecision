# URGENT: Test Transaction Fix NOW! üöÄ

**Date**: October 13, 2025, 16:37  
**Status**: ‚úÖ BUILD SUCCESS - Ready for testing  
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Test immediately  

---

## What Was Fixed

**Root Cause**: Circular deadlock due to `@Transactional` preventing event visibility
- INSERT happened but was invisible to projectors due to transaction isolation
- Transaction couldn't commit because waiting for projection
- Projection couldn't run because transaction not committed
- Result: Timeout after 5 seconds, all changes rolled back

**The Fix**: Removed `@Transactional` from:
1. `StudyFormDataService.submitFormData()` - Line 69
2. `PatientStatusService` - Class-level annotation (Line 70)

**Why It Works**: Axon commits transaction immediately after command, BEFORE waitForProjection() runs.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Application

```powershell
cd C:\nnsproject\clinprecision\backend\clinprecision-clinops-service
java -jar target\clinopsservice-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Watch for**:
- ‚úÖ "Started ClinOpsServiceApplication in X seconds"
- ‚úÖ No startup errors
- ‚úÖ All event processors started

### 2. Test Screening Workflow

1. **Open Browser**: http://localhost:5173 (or your frontend port)
2. **Navigate to Patient**: Click on Patient ID 1 (or any REGISTERED patient)
3. **Click**: "Change Status" button
4. **Select**: "SCREENING" from dropdown
5. **Fill Screening Form**:
   - Screen ID: `SCR-001`
   - Age Requirement: `Yes` (or checkbox)
   - Required Diagnosis: `Yes`
   - No Exclusion Criteria: `Yes`
   - Informed Consent: `Yes`
6. **Click**: "Submit" or "Change Status"

### 3. Expected Results ‚úÖ

**Frontend Should Show** (within 500ms):
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Form submitted successfully"
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Status changed successfully"
- ‚úÖ Patient badge updates to "SCREENING"
- ‚úÖ Status history shows: REGISTERED ‚Üí SCREENING
- ‚úÖ **NO** timeout errors
- ‚úÖ **NO** 5-second delay

**Backend Logs Should Show**:
```
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - POST /api/v1/form-data - Submit form data
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - FormDataSubmittedEvent applied
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - INSERT into domain_event_entry ...
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - SubmitFormDataCommand completed successfully
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - Waiting for form data projection
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - [FormDataProjector] Handling FormDataSubmittedEvent  ‚Üê THIS IS NEW!
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - Form data projection found: attempts=1  ‚Üê THIS IS NEW!
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - PatientStatusChangedEvent emitted
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - INSERT into domain_event_entry ...
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - [PatientProjector] Handling PatientStatusChangedEvent  ‚Üê THIS IS NEW!
2025-10-13 HH:MM:SS - Status history projection found: attempts=1  ‚Üê THIS IS NEW!
```

**Key Differences from Before**:
- ‚úÖ Projectors now receive events (see `[FormDataProjector]` and `[PatientProjector]` logs)
- ‚úÖ Projection found on attempt 1 (not timeout after 13 attempts)
- ‚úÖ Total time < 500ms (not 5000ms)

### 4. Verify Database

```sql
-- Check new events (should be index 54+)
SELECT global_index, aggregate_identifier, payload_type, time_stamp 
FROM domain_event_entry 
ORDER BY global_index DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: 2 new rows with today's timestamp (FormDataSubmittedEvent, PatientStatusChangedEvent)

-- Check form data in read model
SELECT id, aggregate_uuid, study_id, form_id, subject_id, status, created_at
FROM study_form_data
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Expected: 1 new row with your form data

-- Check status history
SELECT id, patient_id, old_status, new_status, changed_at, changed_by
FROM patient_status_history
WHERE patient_id = 1
ORDER BY changed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Expected: 1 new row showing REGISTERED ‚Üí SCREENING
```

---

## If Test SUCCEEDS ‚úÖ

### Celebrate! üéâ
This means:
- ‚úÖ Events persisting correctly
- ‚úÖ Projectors receiving events
- ‚úÖ Read models updating
- ‚úÖ End-to-end flow working
- ‚úÖ Week 2 COMPLETE!

### Next Steps:
1. Test additional workflows:
   - Create new patient ‚Üí Register ‚Üí Screen ‚Üí Enroll
   - Submit enrollment form
   - Submit visit forms
2. Performance testing (multiple patients, concurrent requests)
3. Move to Week 3 (visit scheduling, tracking)

---

## If Test FAILS ‚ùå

### Check These First:

**1. Are Events Being Persisted?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_events, MAX(global_index) as latest_index
FROM domain_event_entry;
-- If latest_index increased, events ARE persisting
```

**2. Are Projectors Running?**
```bash
# Search logs for projector activity
Get-Content logs\clinops-service.log | Select-String -Pattern "FormDataProjector|PatientProjector"
```

**3. Is There a Different Error?**
```bash
# Search for exceptions
Get-Content logs\clinops-service.log | Select-String -Pattern "Exception|Error" | Select-Object -Last 20
```

### Report Back:
1. Frontend behavior (timeout? error message? success but no update?)
2. Backend logs (last 50 lines around the test time)
3. Database state (event count, latest global_index)
4. Any new error messages

---

## Quick Smoke Test (Alternative)

If you want to test just the event persistence without UI:

### Using cURL (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Test form submission
$body = @{
    studyId = 1
    formId = 5
    subjectId = 1
    formData = @{
        screenId = "SCR-TEST-001"
        ageRequirement = "yes"
        requiredDiagnosis = "yes"
        noExclusionCriteria = "yes"
        informedConsent = "yes"
    }
    status = "SUBMITTED"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/form-data" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"

# Expected: JSON response with formDataId and recordId (NOT timeout error)
```

### Check Event Store Immediately:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM domain_event_entry WHERE DATE(time_stamp) = CURDATE();
-- Should return 1 or more
```

## Confidence Assessment

**Likelihood of Success**: 95%+ ‚úÖ

**Why High Confidence**:
1. Root cause definitively identified (transaction isolation)
2. Fix is architecturally correct for Axon Framework
3. BUILD SUCCESS with no errors
4. Pattern matches Axon best practices

**Potential Gotchas** (unlikely but possible):
1. Cached code in running application (restart will fix)
2. Browser cache (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Network delay between services (should still work, just slower)

---

## Debugging Commands (If Needed)

```powershell
# Watch logs in real-time
Get-Content logs\clinops-service.log -Wait -Tail 50

# Search for specific event
Get-Content logs\clinops-service.log | Select-String -Pattern "761c220f-aba3-4666-b1cd-ff6c2180c1bf"

# Check for transaction logs
Get-Content logs\clinops-service.log | Select-String -Pattern "Transaction|Commit|Rollback"

# Count events by type
mysql -u root -p"Admin@123" -D clinprecision -e "SELECT payload_type, COUNT(*) as count FROM domain_event_entry GROUP BY payload_type;"
```

---

## What We Learned

**The Problem Was**:
- Axon's transaction committed events to event store
- But service method's `@Transactional` kept outer transaction open
- Other threads couldn't see uncommitted data (READ COMMITTED isolation)
- Waiting for projection that couldn't see the data = deadlock

**The Solution Is**:
- Remove `@Transactional` from command methods
- Let Axon commit immediately
- Wait for projections AFTER transaction committed
- Events visible to all threads immediately

**Lesson**: In event sourcing, don't wrap command processing in additional transactions!

**Ready to Test?** üöÄ

Just restart the application and try the screening workflow. If you see "Form submitted successfully" and "Status changed successfully" within 500ms, we're DONE! üéâ

If there are any issues, send me:
1. The error message (frontend and/or backend)
2. The last 100 lines of logs
3. The event count query result

Good luck! This should work! üí™
