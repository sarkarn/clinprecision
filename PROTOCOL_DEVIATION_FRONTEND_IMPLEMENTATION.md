|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| < 3 days | MINOR | 🟡 Yellow |
| 3-7 days | MAJOR | 🟠 Orange |
| > 7 days | CRITICAL | 🔴 Red |

## 🔐 Required Context Data

When opening `DeviationModal`, provide:

```javascript
context={{
    patientId: subject.id,           // Required - Database ID
    studySiteId: subject.studySiteId, // Required - Study-site relationship ID
    visitId: visit.id,                // Optional - If deviation tied to visit
    patientName: "John Doe",          // Display only
    studyName: "TRIAL-123",           // Display only
    visitName: "Visit 2 - Week 4",    // Display only (if applicable)
    reportedBy: "Dr. Jane Smith"      // Required - Current user
}}
```

---

## 🚨 Reporting Requirements

### Requires Sponsor/IRB Reporting
Checkbox in modal allows marking deviations that require reporting to:
- **Sponsor** (clinical trial sponsor/CRO)
- **IRB/EC** (Institutional Review Board / Ethics Committee)

### Tracking
- `reportedToSponsor` flag + `sponsorReportDate` timestamp
- `reportedToIrb` flag + `irbReportDate` timestamp
- Visual indicators in DeviationList (✓ Reported / ✗ Not Reported)

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

1. **Study-Site ID Mapping:**
   - Currently using `subject.studySiteId || subject.studyId` as fallback
   - Need to ensure correct `studySiteId` is available from subject data
   - Backend expects `study_site_id` from `site_studies` table

2. **User Authentication Context:**
   - Currently hardcoded `reportedBy: 'Current User'`
   - Need to integrate with auth context to get actual logged-in user

3. **Visit Context in Modal:**
   - Visit ID is optional but should be populated when deviating from visit details page
   - Need to add prop passing from VisitDetails component

4. **Status Update / Add Comment:**
   - Buttons are visible but handlers not yet implemented
   - Need to create modals for these actions

---

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### Scenario: Report a Protocol Deviation

1. **User navigates to SubjectDetails**
   - See subject information, visits, status, etc.
   - Scroll to "Protocol Deviations" section

2. **User clicks "Report Deviation"**
   - Modal opens with patient/study context pre-filled
   - User selects deviation type (e.g., "Visit Window Violation")
   - User selects severity (e.g., "MAJOR")

3. **User fills out form**
   - Title: "Visit 3 completed 5 days late"
   - Description: "Patient missed scheduled visit due to transportation issues"
   - Protocol Section: "Section 6.2 - Visit Windows"
   - Expected: "Visit within ±3 days of Day 28"
   - Actual: "Visit completed on Day 33 (5 days late)"
   - Root Cause: "Patient transportation issues, unable to schedule earlier"
   - Immediate Action: "Visit completed with all assessments"
   - Corrective Action: "Provide patient with study transportation assistance"
   - Requires Reporting: ✓ Checked

4. **User submits**
   - Validation passes
   - API call to backend
   - Success: Modal closes, deviation appears in list
   - Error: Error message displayed, user can correct and resubmit

5. **User views deviation**
   - Deviation displays with MAJOR (orange) severity badge
   - Status shows OPEN (red badge)
   - "Requires Reporting" indicator visible
   - User can expand to see full details
