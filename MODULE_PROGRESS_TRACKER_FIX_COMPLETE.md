# MODULE_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md - Fix Complete ✅

## Date: October 14, 2025

## 🔧 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The `docs/MODULE_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` file had **table corruption** where Phase 6 content was mixed into the module status table structure:

```markdown
| Module | Status | Progress | Priority | Start Date | Target Date |
|--------|------### Success Metrics        <-- CORRUPTION HERE

### Phase 6 (Study Design) - Updated: October 12, 2025  <-- Mixed into table
**Status**: Phase 6C + 6F COMPLETE ✅, Phase 6A-6E REMOVED ❌
...
---|----------|------------|-------------|              <-- Broken table structure
| **1. User Management** | 🟢 Complete | 100% | P0 | Q1 2024 | Q2 2024 |
```

---

## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### 1. Reconstructed Module Status Table
- ✅ Fixed broken table structure
- ✅ Added **module consolidation announcement** at top
- ✅ Updated table to reflect merged "Clinical Operations" module
- ✅ Marked old Subject Management (#4) and Data Capture (#5) as *MERGED*
- ✅ New row: **Clinical Operations** - 40% progress (weighted average)

### 2. Added Module Consolidation Context
Created prominent announcement section:
```markdown
## 🔄 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE: Module Consolidation (October 14, 2025)

**Decision**: MERGE "Subject Management" + "Data Capture" → **"Clinical Operations"**

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard: EDC systems have ONE unified clinical module
- Data Capture only 15% implemented
- Subject Management 55% complete
- Merge is SIMPLE (2 days)
```

### 3. Updated Top Summary Section
```markdown
**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025
**Overall System Progress**: 42% (adjusted for merge)
**Current Sprint**: Clinical Operations Module - Week 2.5 Navigation Update ✅ COMPLETE
```

### 4. Reorganized Content Structure
**Before** (corrupted):
```
Module Table (broken)
Phase 6 content (mixed in table)
Subject Management section
```

**After** (fixed):
```
- Top Summary (with major update banner)
- Module Consolidation Announcement
- Module Status Table (clean, with merge info)
- Phase 6 Completion Summary (properly placed)
- Clinical Operations Combined Status
  - Subject Management Component (55%)
  - Data Capture Component (15%)
- Week 2.5 Architecture Cleanup ✅ COMPLETE
- Week 3 Critical Gap Resolution ⏳ IN PROGRESS
```

### 5. Enhanced Week 2.5 Documentation
Added new section documenting recent work:
- ✅ Type consistency fix (Long for all user IDs)
- ✅ Visit prompt removal (from status changes)
- ✅ Module merge analysis (30+ pages)
- ✅ Module merge plan (2-day roadmap)
- ✅ Navigation UI update (industry standard)

### 6. Updated Week 3 Objectives
Changed focus from generic "visit scheduling" to **critical gap resolution**:
- ⏳ Protocol visit instantiation (Gap #1)
- ⏳ Visit-form association (Gap #2)
- ⏳ Visit windows & compliance (Gap #3)

## 📊 NEW MODULE STRUCTURE

| Module | Status | Progress | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| User Management | 🟢 Complete | 100% | - |
| Site Management | 🟢 Complete | 100% | - |
| Study Design | 🟢 Complete | 100% | Phase 6 complete |
| **Clinical Operations** | 🟡 In Progress | **40%** | **MERGED MODULE** |
| ~~Subject Management~~ | *MERGED* | ~~55%~~ | *Into Clinical Ops* |
| ~~Data Capture~~ | *MERGED* | ~~15%~~ | *Into Clinical Ops* |
| Data Quality | 🔴 Not Started | 0% | P2 |
| Medical Coding | 🔴 Not Started | 0% | P2 |
| Database Lock | 🔴 Not Started | 0% | P2 |
| Regulatory | 🔴 Not Started | 0% | P2 |
| Reporting | 🔴 Not Started | 0% | P3 |

**Clinical Operations Progress** = (Subject Mgmt 55% × 0.7) + (Data Capture 15% × 0.3) ≈ 40%
