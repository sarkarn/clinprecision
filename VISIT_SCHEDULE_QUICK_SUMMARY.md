# Visit Schedule - DDD Migration Quick Summary

## What Changed?

**Visit Schedule now uses DDD/CQRS endpoints instead of bridge endpoints!**

### Before ❌
```
Frontend: /api/studies/1/visits
Backend: Bridge endpoint (didn't exist, we created placeholder)
```

### After ✅
```
Frontend: /clinops-ws/api/clinops/study-design/{studyAggregateUuid}/visits
Backend: DDD endpoints (already existed!)
```

**Important**: `/clinops-ws` prefix required for API gateway routing!

---

## Why This Change?

1. **DDD endpoints already exist** - no need to duplicate
2. **Visits are part of Study Design aggregate** - conceptually correct
3. **Event-sourced** - proper CQRS architecture
4. **Less code** - no bridge duplication needed

---

## Files Changed

### Frontend
- `VisitDefinitionService.js` - All CRUD methods use DDD paths
- `VisitScheduleDesigner.jsx` - Uses `studyAggregateUuid` for operations

### Backend
- `StudyQueryController.java` - Removed placeholder visit endpoint (not needed!)

---

## How It Works

```javascript
// 1. Load study to get UUID
const study = await StudyService.getStudyById(studyId);
// study.studyAggregateUuid = "a1b2c3d4-..."

// 2. Use UUID for visit operations
const visits = await VisitDefinitionService.getVisitsByStudy(
  study.studyAggregateUuid  // ✅ DDD UUID
);
```

---

## Testing

1. **Restart backend**
2. **Navigate to Study Design → Visit Schedule**
3. **Check browser console** - should see:
   ```
   GET /api/clinops/study-design/{uuid}/visits 200 OK
   ```
4. **Try creating/updating/deleting visits**
5. **Verify no 404/500 errors**

---

## Next Steps

**Apply same pattern to Form Bindings:**
- Update `FormBindingService.js` to use DDD paths
- Use `/api/clinops/study-design/{uuid}/form-assignments`
- Follow same pattern as Visit Schedule

---

## Architecture Impact

This sets the precedent for future features:

✅ **Use DDD paths when they exist**  
✅ **Don't create unnecessary bridge endpoints**  
✅ **Respect aggregate boundaries**  
✅ **Use proper UUID identities**

---

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING
