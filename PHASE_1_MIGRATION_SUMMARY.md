## 🏗️ Architecture Impact

### Domain Alignment Fixed ✅

**Before:**
```
Frontend: Study Design Module
Backend:  Data Capture Service  ❌ MISALIGNED
```

**After:**
```
Frontend: Study Design Module
Backend:  Study Design Service  ✅ ALIGNED
```

### Business Context Corrected ✅

Database Build is now correctly placed in the **Study Design Domain** because:
- It's the **last step** of study design
- It **implements** the protocol and forms
- It's a **prerequisite** for data capture operations

## 🔧 Configuration Changes

### 1. Axon Framework Added to Study Design Service ✅

**Dependencies:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>axon-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>4.9.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.clinprecision</groupId>
    <artifactId>clinprecision-axon-lib</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Application Configuration Updated ✅

**Annotations Added:**
```java
@Import(AxonConfig.class)
@EnableJpaRepositories(/* studydatabase.repository */)
@EntityScan(/* studydatabase.entity + Axon tables */)
@ComponentScan(/* com.clinprecision.axon */)
```

### 3. Properties Configuration Added ✅

**Axon Event Sourcing:**
```properties
axon.axonserver.enabled=false
axon.eventhandling.processors.study-database-build-projection.mode=subscribing
```

**Database Build Settings:**
```properties
studydesign.database.build.timeout-minutes=30
studydesign.database.build.max-concurrent-builds=3
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)

1. **Start Services & Test:**
   - Follow: [DB_BUILD_MIGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md](./DB_BUILD_MIGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
   - Start: Config → Eureka → API Gateway → Study Design Service
   - Verify: Service registration in Eureka
   - Test: API endpoints via Postman/curl
   - Test: Frontend integration

2. **Verify Integration:**
   - ✅ No CORS errors
   - ✅ Build list loads
   - ✅ All CRUD operations work
   - ✅ Events are stored
   - ✅ Projections update

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

3. **Monitor in Production:**
   - Watch service logs for errors
   - Monitor Axon event store
   - Track API performance
   - Collect user feedback

4. **Deprecate Old Code:**
   - Add @Deprecated annotations to Data Capture Service studydatabase package
   - Add comments pointing to new location
   - Plan removal date (30 days)

### Medium-term (1-3 months)

5. **Clean Up:**
   - Remove studydatabase package from Data Capture Service
   - Update all documentation
   - Create ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

6. **Plan Phase 2:**
   - Full Clinical Operations Service merge
   - 8-week timeline
   - Consolidate Study Design + Data Capture services

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
- PowerShell scripting for bulk package rename worked perfectly
- Maven compilation caught the one missed import quickly
- Axon Framework integration was straightforward
- Documentation created alongside migration helped track progress

### What to Improve 🔄
- Consider creating automated migration scripts for future moves
- Pre-check all service dependencies before migration
- Have test suite ready before code migration
- Set up CI/CD to auto-test after migration

### What We'd Do Differently 🤔
- Start services immediately after code migration for faster feedback
- Create sample API requests file alongside code
- Set up monitoring dashboard before migration
- Have rollback script ready just in case

## 👥 Team Notes

**For Developers:**
- Database Build code is now in Study Design Service
- Use `com.clinprecision.studydesignservice.studydatabase.*` packages
- Follow testing guide before making changes
- Old code will be deprecated soon, don't use it

**For QA:**
- Follow testing guide for comprehensive test cases
- Check both new and old services during transition
- Report any performance degradation
- Verify all CRUD operations work

**For DevOps:**
- Study Design Service now requires Axon Framework
- Monitor service startup for Axon-related errors
- Check Eureka registration after deployment
- Watch for database connection pool issues
