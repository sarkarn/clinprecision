# Form Design Study Context Updates

## Summary of Changes

The form management system has been updated to be study-aware within the Study Design section. Forms can now be managed in the context of a specific study, providing better integration and workflow.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated FormList Component
- **File**: `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/FormList.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added study context detection via `useParams` to get `studyId`
  - Added study information header when in study context
  - Updated form data to include study-specific information (binding status, visit assignments)
  - Added additional table columns for study context: "Study Binding" and "Visit Schedule"
  - Updated navigation links to be study-aware
  - Added "Bind to Visits" action for study-specific forms

### 2. Updated FormBindingDesigner Component
- **File**: `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/study-design/FormBindingDesigner.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added "Manage Study Forms" button in the header
  - Button navigates to study-specific form management page

### 3. Updated StudyDesignModule Routing
- **File**: `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/StudyDesignModule.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added study-specific form management routes:
    - `/study/:studyId/forms` - Study-specific form list
    - `/study/:studyId/forms/designer` - Study form designer
    - `/study/:studyId/forms/builder` - Study form builder
    - `/study/:studyId/forms/:formId/versions` - Study form versions
    - And other related routes

### 4. Updated StudyEditPage
- **File**: `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/StudyEditPage.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated Form Builder navigation to use study-specific route
  - Changed button text to "Go to Study Form Builder"

### 5. Updated StudyOverviewDashboard
- **File**: `frontend/clinprecision/src/components/modules/trialdesign/study-management/StudyOverviewDashboard.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added "Manage Forms" button that opens study-specific form management
  - Added "Design Study" button that opens study design workflow
  - Both buttons open in new tabs for better workflow

## New User Experience

### Study Context Form Management
When users navigate to form management from within a study context, they will see:

1. **Study Context Header**: Shows study name, protocol, phase, and status
2. **Study-Specific Forms**: Only forms related to the current study
3. **Enhanced Form Information**: 
   - Study binding status (Required/Optional/Not Bound)
   - Visit schedule assignments
   - Study-specific form descriptions
4. **Study-Aware Actions**:
   - Create Study Form (instead of generic Create Form)
   - Bind to Visits (direct link to Form Binding Designer)
   - Edit forms within study context

### Navigation Flow
1. **From Study Overview**: Users can click "Manage Forms" to go to study-specific form management
2. **From Study Design**: The Form Binding phase now includes "Manage Study Forms" button
3. **From Form Management**: Users can return to study design or continue with form binding

### Route Structure
```
/study-design/
├── forms/                          # Global form library
├── study/:studyId/
│   ├── forms/                      # Study-specific form management
│   ├── forms/builder               # Study form builder
│   ├── forms/:formId/versions      # Study form versions
│   └── design/forms/               # Form binding designer
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Context**: Forms are now managed within the context of the specific study
2. **Improved Workflow**: Direct navigation between form management and binding
3. **Enhanced Information**: Study-specific form metadata and binding status
4. **Clearer Actions**: Study-aware actions and buttons
5. **Consistent Navigation**: Proper breadcrumbs and back navigation

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React Router's `useParams` to detect study context
- Conditional rendering based on study presence
- Study-specific data fetching and filtering
- Updated routing with nested study-specific paths
- Enhanced component props and state management

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to a study overview and click "Manage Forms"
2. Verify study context header appears
3. Test form creation from study context
4. Test navigation between form management and binding
5. Verify breadcrumb navigation works correctly
6. Test both global form library and study-specific form management
