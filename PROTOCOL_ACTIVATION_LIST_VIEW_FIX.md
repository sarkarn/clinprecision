# ⚠️ SUPERSEDED - DO NOT USE ⚠️

**This document describes an INCORRECT implementation that was later corrected.**

**See Instead**: [`CRITICAL_WORKFLOW_CORRECTION_FDA_COMPLIANT.md`](./CRITICAL_WORKFLOW_CORRECTION_FDA_COMPLIANT.md)

**Why Superseded**: This document describes disabling the Activate button until study was approved. However, this approach was **backwards** and violated FDA/ICH-GCP regulations. The correct workflow requires protocol activation **BEFORE** study approval, not after.

# Protocol Activation - List View Fix Summary (INCORRECT - FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY)

## Issue Reported
User found another "Activate" button that was not properly checking study status:

**Location**: Protocol Management page (list view)
- Navigation Path: Study List → Click "Manage Protocol" → Protocol Management page shows list of protocol versions
- Problem: "Activate" button enabled even when protocol version is APPROVED but study status is PROTOCOL_REVIEW
- Expected: Button should be disabled with tooltip, just like in the modal view

## Root Cause
The `ProtocolManagementDashboard.jsx` component has its own action button logic in the `getVersionActions()` function that was not checking study status. This was separate from the `ProtocolVersionActions.jsx` component used in the modal view.

## Two Separate Button Locations

### Location 1: List View (Now Fixed ✅)
- **Component**: `ProtocolManagementDashboard.jsx`
- **Function**: `getVersionActions()` 
- **Display**: Inline buttons next to each protocol version in the list
- **Fix Applied**: Added study status validation in APPROVED case

### Location 2: Modal View (Previously Fixed ✅)
- **Component**: `ProtocolVersionActions.jsx`
- **Usage**: Inside `ProtocolVersionManagementModal`
- **Display**: Action buttons in the modal dialog when viewing version details
- **Fix Applied**: Already fixed in previous work

## Changes Made

### File: `ProtocolManagementDashboard.jsx`

**1. Updated APPROVED case in `getVersionActions()`**:
```jsx
case 'APPROVED':
    // Check if study is approved or active before allowing activation
    const studyApproved = study?.studyStatus?.code === 'APPROVED' || study?.studyStatus?.code === 'ACTIVE';
    if (studyApproved) {
        actions.push({
            label: 'Activate',
            icon: CheckCircle,
            onClick: () => handleActivateVersion(version.id),
            variant: 'primary'
        });
    } else {
        actions.push({
            label: 'Activate',
            icon: AlertTriangle,
            onClick: () => { },
            variant: 'outline',
            disabled: true,
            tooltip: 'Study must be approved before protocol version can be activated'
        });
    }
    break;
```

**2. Enhanced button rendering** (lines ~456-475):
- Added `disabled={action.disabled}` prop
- Added `title={action.tooltip || action.label}` for tooltip
- Added `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed` classes

## Behavior Now

### When Protocol APPROVED, Study NOT Approved
**List View**:
- ⚠️ Button shows with AlertTriangle icon
- Button is disabled (grayed out)
- Hover shows tooltip: "Study must be approved before protocol version can be activated"

**Modal View**:
- ⚠️ Button shows with AlertTriangle icon
- Button is disabled (grayed out)
- Hover shows tooltip
- Info banner explains workflow: "Navigate to Publish Study phase and click Approve Study"

### When Protocol APPROVED, Study APPROVED/ACTIVE
**Both Views**:
- ✅ Button enabled with CheckCircle icon
- Button is clickable
- Clicking shows confirmation prompt
- Successfully activates protocol version

## Testing Checklist

- [x] List view shows disabled activate button when study not approved
- [x] List view shows enabled activate button when study is approved
- [x] List view shows tooltip on disabled button
- [x] Modal view shows disabled activate button when study not approved (already working)
- [x] Modal view shows info banner when study not approved (already working)
- [x] Modal view shows enabled activate button when study is approved (already working)
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Consistent behavior between both views

## Consistency Achieved ✅

Both the list view and modal view now have identical validation logic:
1. Check protocol version status = APPROVED
2. Check study status = APPROVED or ACTIVE
3. If study not approved: Show disabled button with warning icon and tooltip
4. If study approved: Show enabled button that allows activation

This provides a consistent user experience regardless of where the user tries to activate a protocol version.
