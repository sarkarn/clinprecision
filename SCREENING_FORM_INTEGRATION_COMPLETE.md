# Status Change with Screening Form Integration - COMPLETE! ✅

## Overview
Successfully integrated the screening assessment form into the status change workflow. When changing a patient's status to "SCREENING", the system now requires completing a screening assessment form before proceeding.

✅ GCP-compliant audit trail
✅ Better user experience
✅ Reduced data entry errors

## 🎓 Clinical Significance

This implementation follows **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)** guidelines by:

1. **Documentation**: Every screening visit is documented with specific criteria
2. **Traceability**: Screening data is stored in audit trail with timestamp and assessor
3. **Eligibility**: Clear determination of patient eligibility
4. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for clinical trial patient screening
5. **Consent**: Confirms informed consent obtained before screening

## 📝 Summary

Successfully integrated screening assessment form into patient status workflow. When changing a patient from REGISTERED to SCREENING status, the system now requires completing a structured screening assessment form before proceeding. This ensures proper documentation, eligibility evaluation, and GCP compliance.

The implementation is **production-ready** and provides a foundation for future enhancements including dedicated backend storage, reporting, and integration with other visit forms.
